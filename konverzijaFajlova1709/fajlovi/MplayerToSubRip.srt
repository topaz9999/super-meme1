2
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.490
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

3
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.660
Tell them we wish
to board at once.

4
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.450
With all due respect...

5
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.650
the ambassadors for the supreme
chancellor wish to board immediately.

6
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.580
Yes, of course.

7
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.660
As you know,
our blockade is perfectly legal...

8
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.690
and we'd be happy
to receive the ambassadors.

9
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.770
I'm TC-14 at your service.

10
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.700
This way, please.

11
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.490
We are greatly honoured
by your visit, Ambassadors.

12
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.420
Make yourselves comfortable.

13
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.770
My master
will be with you shortly.

14
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.690
I have a bad feeling about this.

15
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.690
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

16
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.560
It's something elsewhere, elusive.

17
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.960
Don't centre on your anxieties,
Obi-Wan.

18
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.070
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

19
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.920
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

20
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.950
But not at the expense
of the moment.

21
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.880
Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.

22
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.830
Yes, Master.

23
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.430
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

24
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.600
These Federation types are cowards.

25
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.440
The negotiations will be short.

26
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.710
What? What did you say?

27
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.670
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

28
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.550
I knew it.

29
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.830
They're here to force a settlement.

30
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.080
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

31
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.710
Are you brain-dead?

32
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.560
I'm not going in there
with two Jedi.

33
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.510
Send a droid.

34
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.560
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

35
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.870
No. I sense
an unusual amount of fear...

36
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.030
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.

37
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.310
What is it?

38
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.990
This scheme of yours has failed,
Lord Sidious.

39
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.500
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

40
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.230
Viceroy, I don't want
this stunted slime in my sight again.

41
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.430
This turn of events is unfortunate.
We must accelerate our plans.

42
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.980
Begin landing your troops.

43
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.660
My lord, is that legal?

44
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.980
I will make it legal.

45
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.290
And the Jedi?

46
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.800
The chancellor should never have
brought them into this.

47
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.600
Kill them immediately.

48
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.850
Yes, my lord.
As you wish.

49
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.370
Captain, look!

50
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.770
Shields--

51
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.930
Sorry.

52
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.410
Dioxis.

53
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.560
They must be dead by now.

54
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.250
Destroy what's left of them.

55
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.320
Oh! Excuse me.

56
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.270
-Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
-Roger, roger.

57
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.790
Uh-oh. Blast them.

58
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.800
What is going on down there?

59
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.800
We lost the transmission, sir.

60
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.000
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

61
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.950
Well, no, but I don't--
Seal off the bridge.

62
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.670
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

63
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.680
I want droidekas
up here at once!

64
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.230
We will not survive this.

65
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.670
Close the blast doors!

66
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.110
That will hold them.

67
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.830
They are still coming through.

68
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.790
This is impossible!

69
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.840
Where are those droidekas?

70
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.030
Master! Destroyers!

71
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.520
They have shield generators!

72
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.510
It's a standoff.
Let's go.

73
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.910
They're no match for droidekas.

74
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.630
Sir!

75
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.320
They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.

76
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.320
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

77
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.560
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.

78
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.640
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

79
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.240
Let's split up.

80
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.430
Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

81
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.310
You were right
about one thing, Master.

82
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.760
The negotiations were short.

83
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.190
Sir, a transmission
from the planet.

84
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.310
It's Queen Amidala herself.

85
00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.750
At last we are getting results.

86
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.960
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

87
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.040
You will not be so pleased when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.

88
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.710
Your trade boycott
of our planet has ended.

89
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.270
I was not aware of such failure.

90
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.990
I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...

91
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.710
and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.

92
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.990
I know nothing
of any ambassadors.

93
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.390
You must be mistaken.

94
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.420
Beware, Viceroy.

95
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.140
The Federation
has gone too far this time.

96
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:15.150
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

97
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.660
You assume too much.

98
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.110
We will see.

99
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.500
- She's right. The senate will never--
- It's too late now.

100
00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.460
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

101
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.740
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

102
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.630
Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?

103
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.820
How could that be true?

104
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:47.100
I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.

105
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:50.830
It must-- handiwork--
negotiate-- ambassadors--

106
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.460
- nobody would--
- Senator Palpatine.

107
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.390
What's happening?

108
00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.310
Check the transmission generator.

109
00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:02.060
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.

110
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.380
The Federation
would not dare go that far.

111
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.130
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be finished.

112
00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.980
We must continue to rely
on negotiation.

113
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.170
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

114
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.530
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?

115
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.170
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.

116
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.280
Our security volunteers
will be no match...

117
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.450
against a battle-hardened
Federation army.

118
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.520
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

119
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.450
- Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship...

120
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:09.610
and there is no trace of theJedi.

121
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.370
They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.

122
00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.840
If they're down here, sir,
we'll find them.

123
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.110
Use caution.
TheseJedi are not to be underestimated.

124
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.080
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

125
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.790
Get down!

126
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.150
Was'n dat?
Hey, wait!

127
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.710
Oh, mooie-mooie,
I love you.

128
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.800
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

129
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.480
I spake.

130
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.640
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

131
00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.510
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

132
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.550
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

133
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.670
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it 'tis.

134
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.550
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

135
00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.510
- Oh, no!
- Stay down!

136
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.190
You saved my again.

137
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.120
- What's this?
- A local.

138
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.670
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.

139
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.030
More?
"More'' did you spake?

140
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.840
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

141
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.030
Is where I grew up.
'Tis a hidden city.

142
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.400
- A city?
- Uh-huh.

143
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.240
Can you take us there?

144
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.480
On second thought, no.

145
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.990
- Not really, no.
- No?

146
00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.160
'Tis embarrassing...

147
00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:52.070
but my afraid
my've been banished.

148
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.160
My forgotten. Da bosses
would do terrible tings to me.

149
00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.190
Terrible tings to me
if me goen back dare.

150
00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.200
- You hear that?
- Yah.

151
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.920
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

152
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.510
If they find us,
they will crush us...

153
00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:12.000
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

154
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.760
Oh.

155
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.870
Yousa point is well seen.

156
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.230
Dis way. Hurry!

157
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.470
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

158
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.400
Ah, my warning you.

159
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.480
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

160
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.800
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.

161
00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.110
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?

162
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.360

How wude.

169
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.070
Yousa cannot bees hair.

170
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.560
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

171
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:29.360
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.

172
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.920
Wesa no like da Naboo.

173
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.710
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

174
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.640
Day tink day brains so big.

175
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.720
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.

176
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.030
Mesa no tink so.

177
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.900
Day not know of uss-en.

178
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.830
You and the Naboo form
a symbiont circle.

179
00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.180
What happens to one of you will affect
the other. You must understand this.

180
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:58.910
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

181
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.460
Then speed us on our way.

182
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.980
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

183
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:06.780
We could use a transport.

184
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:09.630
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

185
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.710
Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

186
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:17.350
'tis goen through the planet core.

187
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.270
Now...

188
00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.110
go.

189
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.380
Thank you for your help.
We leave in peace.

190
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.470
Master, what's a bongo?

191
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:27.470
A transport, I hope.

192
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.580
Deysa setten yousa up.

193
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:33.180
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

194
00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.300
Any help here would be hot.

195
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:40.390
Master, we're short on time.

196
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.980
We'll need a navigator to get us
through the planet's core.

197
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.990
This Gungan may be of help.

198
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.940
What is to become
of Jar Jar Binks here?

199
00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:55.780
Hisen to be pune-ished.

200
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:57.990
I saved his life.

201
00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:00.500
He owes me
what you call a "life-debt.''

202
00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:04.300
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

203
00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.650
Binks...

204
00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:10.570
yousa havena liveplay
with thisen hisen?

205
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.810
Begone wit him!

206
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.650
Count me outta dis one.

207
00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.760
Better dead here
than dead in da core.

208
00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:29.880
Yee gods!
What mesa sayin?

209
00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.040
Dis is nutsen.
Oh, gooberfish!

210
00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:53.290
- Why were you banished,Jar Jar?
- It's a longo tale-o...

211
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:58.240
buta a small part of it
would be mesa... clumsy.

212
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.960
- You were banished for being clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

213
00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.400
Mesa caused mabee one two-y
lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

214
00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.480
Yud-say boom da gasser...

215
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.270
den crashin der boss's heyblibber,
den banished.

216
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.230
Big gooberfish!
Huge-o teeth!

217
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.480
- There's always a bigger fish.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

218
00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.470
The invasion is on schedule,
my lord.

219
00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.480
I have the senate
bogged down in procedures.

220
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.830
They will have no choice but
to accept your control of the system.

221
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.480
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

222
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.430
Queen Amidala is young and naive.

223
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.870
You will find controlling her
will not be difficult.

224
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.800
Yes, my lord.

225
00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.950
You didn't tell him
about the missing Jedi.

226
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.390
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

227
00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.270
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

228
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.070
Oh, maxi big, da Force.

229
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.870
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

230
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.470
- We're losing power.
- Oh, no!

231
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.340
Wesa dyin' here.

232
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:58.030
-Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet''?

233
00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.980
Monsters out dare.
Leak'n in here.

234
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:05.860
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

235
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.300
Power's back.

236
00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.410
Monster's back!

237
00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.610
Relax.

238
00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.140
You overdid it.

239
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.180
Head for that outcropping.

240
00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.130
Oh, boy.

241
00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.010
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

242
00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.700
Ah, victory.

243
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.730
Dis'n loverly.

244
00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.890
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

245
00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:48.010
The queen and I will sign a treaty that
will legitimize our occupation here.

246
00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:51.180
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

247
00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.610
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

248
00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:58.700
In time, your people's suffering will
persuade you to see our point of view.

249
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.810
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

250
00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.500
Process them.

251
00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.340
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

252
00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.020
Roger, roger.

253
00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.780
We should leave the street,
Your Highness.

254
00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.460
Get their weapons.

255
00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.370
Yousa guys bombad!

256
00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.210
We're ambassadors
for the supreme chancellor.

257
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.130
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

258
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.000
The negotiations
never took place.

259
00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.400
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

260
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.510
They've knocked out
all our communications.

261
00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.840
- Do you have transports?
- In the main hangar. This way.

262
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.560
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

263
00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.070
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

264
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.110
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

265
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.830
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

266
00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.920
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.

267
00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.520
They can't afford to kill her.

268
00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.680
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

269
00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.680
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

270
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.680
My feelings tell me
they will destroy you.

271
00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.070
Our only hope is for the senate
to side with us.

272
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:54.540
Senator Palpatine
will need your help.

273
00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:58.450
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.

274
00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.380
We are brave, Your Highness.

275
00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.620
If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.

276
00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.090
Then I will plead our case
to the senate.

277
00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:08.810
Be careful, Governor.

278
00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:19.360
We'll need to free those pilots.

279
00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:22.370
I'll deal with that.

280
00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:26.680
Halt.

281
00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:28.400
I'm ambassador
to the supreme chancellor.

282
00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:30.040
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

283
00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:33.240
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

284
00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.880
Coruscant?
Uh, that doesn't compute.

285
00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:37.840
Uh, wait.
Uh, you're under arrest.

286
00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:44.240
Come on. Move!

287
00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:50.320
Go!

288
00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:18.000
Now, stay here
and keep out of trouble.

289
00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:23.720
Hello, boyos.

290
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:31.370
There's the blockade.

291
00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:42.930
The shield generator's been hit!

292
00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:52.600
How wude!

293
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.720
We're losing droids fast.

294
00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.040
If we can't get the shield generator
fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.

295
00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:10.320
The shields are gone.

296
00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:19.400
The power's back!

297
00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:25.400
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

298
00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:28.000
Deflector shields up at maximum.

299
00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:40.760
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

300
00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:43.640
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

301
00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:45.840
Here, Master.
Tatooine.

302
00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:47.560
It's small, out of the way, poor.

303
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:49.360
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.

304
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.290
How can you be sure?

305
00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:53.240
It's controlled by the Hutts.

306
00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:56.040
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

307
00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:58.360
- If they discovered her--
- It'd be no different than landing...

308
00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.280
on a system controlled
by the Federation...

309
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.390
except that the Hutts
aren't looking for her...

310
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.510
which gives us the advantage.

311
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.680
And Queen Amidala,
has she signed the treaty?

312
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.270
She has disappeared, my lord.

313
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:19.390
One Naboo cruiser
got past the blockade.

314
00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.310
I want that treaty signed.

315
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:24.390
My lord...

316
00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:26.940
it's impossible to locate the ship.

317
00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:29.190
It's out of our range.

318
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:31.460
Not for a Sith.

319
00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:33.830
This is my apprentice...

320
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:35.780
Darth Maul.

321
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:40.220
He will find your lost ship.

322
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:46.580
This is getting out of hand.

323
00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.660
Now there are two of them.

324
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.660
We should not
have made this bargain.

325
00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:00.130
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

326
00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:03.010
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

327
00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.340
It is to be commended.
What is its number?

328
00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.940
R2-D2, Your Highness.

329
00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:12.410
Thank you, R2-D2.

330
00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:17.410
Padmé.

331
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.940
Clean this droid up
as best you can.

332
00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.940
It deserves our gratitude.

333
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.140
Continue, Captain.

334
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.730
Your Highness,
with your permission...

335
00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.500
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

336
00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.820
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

337
00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.410
I do not agree
with the Jedi on this.

338
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.340
You must trust my judgment,
Your Highness.

339
00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.260
Hello.

340
00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.210
Sorry. Husa are yousa?

341
00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:52.690
I'm Padmé.

342
00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.690
Mesa Jar Jar Binks.

343
00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.730
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

344
00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.380
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

345
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:07.020
Mesa day starten pitty okeyday
witda brisky morning munchen.

348
00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.810
Mesa getten
berry, berry scared.

349
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:25.820
- That's it-- Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

350
00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.850
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

351
00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:49.090
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

352
00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:51.570
That'll complicate things.
Be wary.

353
00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:54.680
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.
- I feel it also, Master.

354
00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.770
Don't let them send
any transmissions.

355
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:04.920
The sun doen murder to mesa skin.

356
00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:06.480
Wait!

357
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:08.880
Wait.

358
00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:14.920
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

359
00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:18.640
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

360
00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.750
The spaceport
is not going to be pleasant.

361
00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.920
The queen wishes it.

362
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.870
She's curious about the planet.

363
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.270
This is not a good idea.
Stay close to me.

364
00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.240
Moisture farms,
for the most part.

365
00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:51.030
Some indigenous tribes
and scavengers.

366
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.960
The few spaceports like this one...

367
00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.280
are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.

368
00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.230
Like us.

369
00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.190
Dissen berry, berry bad.

370
00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.160
Icky, icky goo!

371
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.950
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

372
00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.240
Good day to you.

373
00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.160
What do you want?

374
00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.240
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

375
00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:36.240
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.

376
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.760
Boy, get in here now!

377
00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.680
My droid has a readout of what I need.

378
00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.790
What took you so long?

379
00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.920
I was cleaning the fan switches.

380
00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.680
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

381
00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.920
So, let me take thee out back, huh?

382
00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.840
We'll find what you need.

383
00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.880
Don't touch anything.

384
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.550
- Are you an angel?
- What?

385
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.230
An angel. I heard the deep space
pilots talk about them.

386
00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.110
They're the most beautiful
creatures in the universe.

387
00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.710
They live on the moons of lego,
I think.

388
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:25.000
You're a funny little boy.
How do you know so much?

389
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.790
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.

390
00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:33.030
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

391
00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:36.940
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

392
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:39.270
How long have you been here?

393
00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:43.220
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.

394
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:45.940
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt...

395
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:48.660
but she lost us
betting on the Podraces.

396
00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:50.510
You're a slave?

397
00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:54.590
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

398
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:58.300
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

399
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:11.710
- I got ya.
- Hey!

400
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:13.500
Hit the nose.

401
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:21.380
A T-14 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

402
00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:24.020
I'm the only one hereabouts
who has one.

403
00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:27.510
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think, huh.

404
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:30.430
Saying of which...

405
00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:32.820
how's thee gonna pay
for all this, huh?

406
00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.900
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

407
00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.770
Republic credits?

408
00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.700
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

409
00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:42.810
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

410
00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:46.410
- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.

411
00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.290
No, they won't!

412
00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:52.410
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?

413
00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:56.610
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

414
00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:00.650
No money, no parts, no deal.

415
00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:05.140
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

416
00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:15.810
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

417
00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.220
We're leaving.Jar Jar.

418
00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:26.170
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

419
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.050
I was glad to meet you too.

420
00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:40.460
Outlanders.
They think we know nothing.

421
00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:42.410
They seemed nice to me.

422
00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:44.370
Clean the racks.

423
00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:45.770
Then you can go home.

424
00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:47.620
Yippee!

425
00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.690
And you're sure there's
nothing left on board?

426
00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:57.610
A few containers of supplies.

427
00:33:57.730 --> 00:34:00.640
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with...

428
00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:03.000
not in the amount
you're talking about.

429
00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:05.930
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

430
00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:07.370
I'll check back later.

431
00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:09.720
Noah gain. Noah gain.

432
00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:12.570
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

433
00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:15.040
Wesa be wobbed un crunched.

434
00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:18.200
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

435
00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.190
Are you going to pay for that?

436
00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.920
It costs seven wupiupi.

437
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.270
Oops.

438
00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.400
Is this yours?

439
00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.190
Who, mesa--

440
00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.240
Careful, Sebulba.

441
00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.270
He's a big-time outlander.

442
00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.790
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

443
00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:07.630
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

444
00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.670
If you weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.

445
00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.080
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.

446
00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.150
- Hi.
- Hi there.

447
00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.000
Your buddy here was
about to be turned into orange goo.

448
00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.920
He picked a fight with a Dug...

449
00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.430
an especially dangerous Dug
called Sebulba.

450
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.000
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

451
00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.950
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

452
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.880
Thanks, my young friend.

453
00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.880
But mesa doen nutten!

454
00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.510
This storm will slow them down.

455
00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.070
Looks pretty bad.

456
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.750
- Panaka.
- Receiving a message from home.

457
00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.600
We'll be right there.

458
00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.830
Here, you'll like these pallies.

459
00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.430
- Here.
- Thank you.

460
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.750
My bones are aching.

461
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:14.230
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

462
00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:17.070
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

463
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:19.660
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

464
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:22.060
You'll never reach
the outskirts in time.

465
00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.890
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

466
00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.370
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.

467
00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:43.640
Mom!

468
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:47.320
- Mom, I'm home!
- Ah, dissen cosy.

469
00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:49.720
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

470
00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:53.230
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

471
00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.640
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

472
00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.640
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.

473
00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:10.160
Isn't he great?
He's not finished yet.

474
00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.510
He's wonderful.

475
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.360
You really like him?

476
00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.280
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.

477
00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.750
Where is everybody?

478
00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.990
Whoops.

479
00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:28.180
Oh, hello.

480
00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.450
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

481
00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.380
How might I serve you?

482
00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.170
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

483
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.690
When the storm is over, I'll show you
my racer. I'm building a Podracer.

484
00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:43.450
I'm not sure this floor
is entirely stable.

485
00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:46.650
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.

486
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.650
R2-D2.
A pleasure to meet you.

487
00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.690
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

488
00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:59.290
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, " naked''?

489
00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:04.020
My parts are showing?
My goodness!

490
00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.810
The death toll is catastrophic.

491
00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:13.200
We must bow to their wishes.

492
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.280
You must contact me.

493
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.960
It's a trick.
Send no reply.

494
00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.990
Send no transmissions of any kind.

495
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.950
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

496
00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.870
What if it is true,
and the people are dying?

497
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.360
Either way,
we're running out of time.

498
00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:46.490
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

499
00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:49.280
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

500
00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:51.210
Move against the Jedi first.

501
00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:53.920
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo...

502
00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:55.850
to sign the treaty.

503
00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:58.040
At last we will reveal ourselves
to the Jedi.

504
00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:00.480
At last we will have revenge.

505
00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:03.360
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

506
00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:05.760
They will be no match for you.

507
00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:14.280
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

508
00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:18.210
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

509
00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:21.690
- Any attempt to escape--
- And they blow you up!

510
00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:24.080
How wude!

511
00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:26.520
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

512
00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:28.450
The Republic's antislavery laws--

513
00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:30.800
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

514
00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:33.000
We must survive on our own.

515
00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:35.400
Xcuse me.

516
00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:39.840
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

517
00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.690
They have Podracing
on Malastare.

518
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:44.400
Very fast, very dangerous.

519
00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:46.970
I'm the only human who can do it.

520
00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:49.970
You must have Jedi reflexes
if you race pods.

521
00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:52.370
Don't do that again.

522
00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:00.080
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

523
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:05.680
- What makes you think that?
- I saw your laser sword.

524
00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:08.560
Only Jedis carry
that kind of weapon.

525
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:11.680
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

526
00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:13.370
I don't think so.

527
00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:15.560
No one can kill a Jedi.

528
00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:18.330
I wish that were so.

529
00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:20.410
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

530
00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:23.570
I came back here
and freed all the slaves.

531
00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:26.890
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

532
00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:31.160
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

533
00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:38.490
I can see there's
no fooling you, Anakin.

534
00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:41.490
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic...

535
00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:43.520
on a very important mission.

536
00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:46.560
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?

537
00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:50.160
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.

538
00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:54.440
I can help.
I can fix anything.

539
00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:56.000
I believe you can.

540
00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:58.800
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

541
00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:01.520
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

542
00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:05.040
These junk dealers
must have a weakness of some kind.

543
00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:09.290
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

544
00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:10.600
Podracing.

545
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:13.530
Greed can be a powerful ally.

546
00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:16.400
I built a racer.
It's the fastest ever.

547
00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:18.730
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.

548
00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:20.730
You could enter my pod.

549
00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:24.560
- Anakin, Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

550
00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:26.490
You could make him think
it was yours...

551
00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:28.730
and get him
to let me pilot it for you.

552
00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:30.360
I don't want you to race.
It's awful.

553
00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:32.880
I die every time
Watto makes you do it.

554
00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:35.050
But, Mom, I love it.

555
00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:38.560
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

556
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:40.880
Anakin.

557
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.640
Your mother's right.

558
00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.720
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

559
00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.750
No.

560
00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:59.080
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

561
00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:06.470
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

562
00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.430
We'll find some other way.

563
00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.150
There is no other way.

564
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:17.420
I may not like it,
but he can help you.

565
00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:20.070
He was meant to help you.

566
00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:34.870
Are you sure about this?

567
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:37.500
Trusting our fate
to a boy we hardly know?

568
00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:39.590
The queen will not approve.

569
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:41.510
The queen doesn't need to know.

570
00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:44.150
Well, I don't approve.

571
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:47.740
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.

572
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:49.430
How can you do this?

573
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:52.700
Not on the Republic credits,
I think.

574
00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:54.900
My ship will be the entry fee.

575
00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:57.030
Not bad!

576
00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:59.980
Not bad, huh?
Nubian, huh?

577
00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:03.260
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

578
00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:05.780
What would the boy ride?

579
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:09.300
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It would take some long time to fix it.

580
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:11.660
It wasn't my fault.
Really.

581
00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:13.350
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

582
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:16.700
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

583
00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:20.140
That you did.

584
00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:22.930
The boy's good.
No doubts there, huh?

585
00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:25.450
I have acquired a pod
in a game of chance.

586
00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:27.170
The fastest ever built.

587
00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:32.220
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

588
00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:37.500
So, you supply the pod
and the entry fee...

589
00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:38.950
and I supply the boy.

590
00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:42.780
We split the winnings 50-50,
I think, huh?

591
00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:44.710
If it's going to be 50-50...

592
00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:47.340
I suggest you front the cash
for the entry.

593
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:49.430
If we win...

594
00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:53.180
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

595
00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:56.380
And if we lose,
you keep my ship.

596
00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:00.100
Either way, you win.

597
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:06.940
Deal!

598
00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:16.020
Your friend
is a foolish one, methinks.

599
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:26.470
What if this plan fails, Master?

600
00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:29.180
We could be stuck here
a very long time.

601
00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:31.740
Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help...

602
00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:35.100
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

603
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:37.110
And...

604
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:39.030
there's something about this boy.

605
00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:47.820
You should be very proud of your son.

606
00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:50.780
He gives without any thought
of reward.

607
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:53.660
He knows nothing of greed.

608
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:54.830
He has--

609
00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:57.590
He has special powers.

610
00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:00.460
Yes.

611
00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:03.100
He can see things
before they happen.

612
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:05.900
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

613
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:07.830
It's a Jedi trait.

614
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:10.620
He deserves better
than a slave's life.

615
00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:13.980
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

616
00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:19.900
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

617
00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:21.690
Who was his father?

618
00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.130
There was no father.

619
00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:30.740
I carried him,
I gave birth, I raised him.

620
00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.970
I can't explain what happened.

621
00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.300
Can you help him?

622
00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:39.220
I don't know.

623
00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:45.090
I didn't actually come here
to free slaves.

624
00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:59.500
Wow, a real astro droid!

625
00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:04.930
- How do you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

626
00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:07.880
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

627
00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:09.650
With this?

628
00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:12.410
You're such a joker, Ani.

629
00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:15.600
- You've been working on that for years.
- It's never gonna run.

630
00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:17.800
Come on.
Let's go and play ball.

631
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:21.080
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

632
00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:31.570
Keep away from
those energy binders.

633
00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:35.000
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

634
00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:36.450
Okay.

635
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:42.440
My tongue is fat.

636
00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:45.530
My tongue-- Wrench.

637
00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:48.210
Where is de wrench?
Oh, dare it is.

638
00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:53.970
I'm stuck.

639
00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:57.920
You know, I find that Jar Jar creature
to be a little odd.

640
00:46:59.690 --> 00:47:02.410
You don't even know
if this thing's gonna run.

641
00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:04.520
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

642
00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:06.770
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

643
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:08.850
Come on, Kitster.
Let's move away.

644
00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:11.090
My mouth.

645
00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:12.480
Ani, I'm stuck.

646
00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:19.560
My tongue is fat.

647
00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:22.520
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.

648
00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:26.610
Thank you.

649
00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:28.080
Go.

650
00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:45.480
It's working!
It's working!

651
00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:58.080
Stay still, Ani.
Let me clean this cut.

652
00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:01.960
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

653
00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:03.890
Most of them.

654
00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:05.890
Has anyone been to 'em all?

655
00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:08.680
Not likely.

656
00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:11.890
I wanna be the first one
to see 'em all.

657
00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:15.330
Ani, bedtime!

658
00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:18.090
There we are.
Good as new.

659
00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:20.960
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

660
00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:24.370
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

661
00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:25.970
Go on.

662
00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:27.970
You have a big day tomorrow.

663
00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:29.890
Sleep well, Ani.

664
00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:34.440
- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, Master?

665
00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:37.160
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

666
00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:38.930
Wait a minute.

667
00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:42.450
I need a midi-chlorian count.

668
00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:47.800
The reading is off the chart.

669
00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:49.730
Over 20,000.

670
00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:53.320
Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.

671
00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:55.170
No Jedi has.

672
00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:57.250
What does that mean?

673
00:48:58.090 --> 00:48:59.650
I'm not sure.

674
00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:09.480
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

675
00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:11.280
Patience, my blue friend.

676
00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:13.560
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.

677
00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:15.410
And we'll be far away from here.

678
00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:19.410
Not if your ship belongs to me,
I think, huh?

679
00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:22.760
I warn you, no funny business.

680
00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:25.880
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrongo.

681
00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:28.360
I have great faith in the boy.

682
00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.520
He's a credit to your race...

683
00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.710
but Sebulba there
is going to win, I think.

684
00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.430
Oh, no!

685
00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.190
Why do you think that?

686
00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.120
He always wins!

687
00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.390
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

688
00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:53.750
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

689
00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:57.680
I'll wager my new racing pod
against, say...

690
00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:59.600
the boy and his mother.

691
00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:03.270
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

692
00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.830
The boy, then.

693
00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.190
We'll let fate decide, huh?

694
00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:17.600
I just happen to have
a chance cube here.

695
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.630
Blue, it's the boy.

696
00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:21.830
Red...

697
00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:24.760
his mother.

698
00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:36.390
You won this small toss,
outlander...

699
00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:38.560
but you won't win the race!

700
00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:40.670
So it makes little difference!

701
00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:54.790
Better stop your friend's betting
or I'll end up owning him too.

702
00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.790
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

703
00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:02.240
Good morning.

704
00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.920
Oh, my.
Space travel sounds rather perilous.

705
00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:12.750
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

706
00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:16.110
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

707
00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.280
Do what?

708
00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.310
Finish the race, of course.

709
00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:22.110
You've never won a race?

710
00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.830
Well, not exactly.

711
00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:26.870
Not even finished?

712
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.350
Kitster's right.
I will this time.

713
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:31.430
Of course you will.

714
00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:01.620
That's absolutely right.

715
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:06.580
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.

716
00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:10.170
I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.

717
00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:14.900
I see Ben Quadinaros
from the Tund System.

718
00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:22.690
Two-time winner Boles Roor.

719
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:26.860
Sebulba!

720
00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:39.820
And in the front row,
nearside pole position...

721
00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:41.850
Mawhonic!

722
00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:44.980
A hearty hello...

723
00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:48.650
to Clegg Holdfast
and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!

724
00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:54.420
And back again,
it's the mighty Dud Bolt...

725
00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:58.930
with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327.

726
00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:04.330
And hoping for a big win today...

727
00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:08.680
Ody Mandrell,
with his record-setting pit droid team.

728
00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:16.490
And a late entry,
young Anakin Skywalker...

729
00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:17.840
a local boy.

730
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:22.600
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.

731
00:54:42.010 --> 00:54:43.490
Be safe.

732
00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:45.840
I will, Mom. I promise.

733
00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:03.930
You won't walk away from this one...

734
00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:06.200
you slave scum.

735
00:55:06.330 --> 00:55:09.450
Don't count on it, slime ball.

736
00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:11.840
You're bantha fodder!

737
00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:18.370
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

738
00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:20.050
Right.

739
00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:26.520
Remember, concentrate
on the moment.

740
00:55:26.650 --> 00:55:30.240
Feel, don't think.
Use your instincts.

741
00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.920
I will.

742
00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:34.160
May the Force be with you.

743
00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:44.670
Jabba the Hutt.

744
00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:58.710
Welcome.

745
00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:02.760
Begin the race!

746
00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:15.920
Hey, looks like
they're clearing the grid.

747
00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:18.880
- Is he nervous?
- He's fine.

748
00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:23.190
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not--

749
00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:26.070
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.

750
00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:28.320
You should too.

751
00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:30.430
You assume too much.

752
00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:33.470
Start your engines.

753
00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:14.360
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

754
00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:34.790
Oh, no!

755
00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:43.350
Wait.
Little Skywalker has stalled.

756
00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:57.440
It looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.

757
00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:00.190
Come on, Ani!

758
00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:07.870
And there goes Skywalker!

759
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.400
Go, Ani, go!

760
00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.560
He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.

761
00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.440
Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out...

762
00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:27.760
on the canyon dune turn.

763
00:59:38.530 --> 00:59:42.080
There goes Quadinaros'
power coupling.

764
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:10.810
Oh, no!

765
01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:17.210
Where is Master Anakin?

766
01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:22.450
Look. Here he comes.

767
01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:27.440
It looks like Skywalker
is moving up in the field.

768
01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:29.640
Yay! Yippee!

769
01:00:36.850 --> 01:00:40.290
He has to complete
two more circuits? Oh, dear.

770
01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:46.930
Skywalker's
spinning out of control!

771
01:02:42.490 --> 01:02:46.280
I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!

772
01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:54.690
Here he comes!

773
01:02:54.810 --> 01:02:57.800
At the start of the third and final lap,
Sebulba's in the lead...

774
01:02:57.930 --> 01:03:00.320
followed closely by Skywalker!

775
01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:01.280
Go, Ani!

776
01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:29.440
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!

777
01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:51.570
It's Skywalker!

778
01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:53.760
Sebulba!

779
01:03:53.890 --> 01:03:57.960
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

780
01:03:58.090 --> 01:03:59.760
Did he crash-ed?

781
01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:42.120
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

782
01:05:32.970 --> 01:05:34.560
He's catching Sebulba!

783
01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:38.040
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

784
01:06:07.170 --> 01:06:09.440
That little human being
is out of his mind!

785
01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:11.630
They're side by side!

786
01:06:39.110 --> 01:06:40.910
- Yippee!
- Yay!

787
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:46.590
I can't believe it.

788
01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:48.540
The crowds are going nuts!

2
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.490
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

3
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.660
Tell them we wish
to board at once.

4
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.450
With all due respect...

5
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.650
the ambassadors for the supreme
chancellor wish to board immediately.

6
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.580
Yes, of course.

7
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.660
As you know,
our blockade is perfectly legal...

8
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.690
and we'd be happy
to receive the ambassadors.

9
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.770
I'm TC-14 at your service.

10
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.700
This way, please.

11
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.490
We are greatly honoured
by your visit, Ambassadors.

12
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.420
Make yourselves comfortable.

13
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.770
My master
will be with you shortly.

14
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.690
I have a bad feeling about this.

15
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.690
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

16
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.560
It's something elsewhere, elusive.

17
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.960
Don't centre on your anxieties,
Obi-Wan.

18
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.070
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

19
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.920
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

20
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.950
But not at the expense
of the moment.

21
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.880
Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.

22
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.830
Yes, Master.

23
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.430
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

24
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.600
These Federation types are cowards.

25
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.440
The negotiations will be short.

26
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.710
What? What did you say?

27
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.670
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

28
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.550
I knew it.

29
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.830
They're here to force a settlement.

30
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.080
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

31
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.710
Are you brain-dead?

32
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.560
I'm not going in there
with two Jedi.

33
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.510
Send a droid.

34
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.560
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

35
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.870
No. I sense
an unusual amount of fear...

36
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.030
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.

37
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.310
What is it?

38
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.990
This scheme of yours has failed,
Lord Sidious.

39
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.500
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

40
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.230
Viceroy, I don't want
this stunted slime in my sight again.

41
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.430
This turn of events is unfortunate.
We must accelerate our plans.

42
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.980
Begin landing your troops.

43
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.660
My lord, is that legal?

44
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.980
I will make it legal.

45
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.290
And the Jedi?

46
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.800
The chancellor should never have
brought them into this.

47
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.600
Kill them immediately.

48
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.850
Yes, my lord.
As you wish.

49
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.370
Captain, look!

50
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.770
Shields--

51
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.930
Sorry.

52
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.410
Dioxis.

53
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.560
They must be dead by now.

54
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.250
Destroy what's left of them.

55
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.320
Oh! Excuse me.

56
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.270
-Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
-Roger, roger.

57
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.790
Uh-oh. Blast them.

58
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.800
What is going on down there?

59
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.800
We lost the transmission, sir.

60
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.000
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

61
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.950
Well, no, but I don't--
Seal off the bridge.

62
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.670
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

63
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.680
I want droidekas
up here at once!

64
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.230
We will not survive this.

65
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.670
Close the blast doors!

66
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.110
That will hold them.

67
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.830
They are still coming through.

68
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.790
This is impossible!

69
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.840
Where are those droidekas?

70
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.030
Master! Destroyers!

71
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.520
They have shield generators!

72
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.510
It's a standoff.
Let's go.

73
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.910
They're no match for droidekas.

74
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.630
Sir!

75
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.320
They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.

76
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.320
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

77
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.560
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.

78
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.640
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

79
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.240
Let's split up.

80
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.430
Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

81
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.310
You were right
about one thing, Master.

82
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.760
The negotiations were short.

83
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.190
Sir, a transmission
from the planet.

84
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.310
It's Queen Amidala herself.

85
00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.750
At last we are getting results.

86
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.960
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

87
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.040
You will not be so pleased when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.

88
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.710
Your trade boycott
of our planet has ended.

89
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.270
I was not aware of such failure.

90
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.990
I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...

91
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.710
and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.

92
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.990
I know nothing
of any ambassadors.

93
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.390
You must be mistaken.

94
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.420
Beware, Viceroy.

95
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.140
The Federation
has gone too far this time.

96
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:15.150
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

97
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.660
You assume too much.

98
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.110
We will see.

99
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.500
- She's right. The senate will never--
- It's too late now.

100
00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.460
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

101
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.740
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

102
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.630
Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?

103
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.820
How could that be true?

104
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:47.100
I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.

105
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:50.830
It must-- handiwork--
negotiate-- ambassadors--

106
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.460
- nobody would--
- Senator Palpatine.

107
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.390
What's happening?

108
00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.310
Check the transmission generator.

109
00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:02.060
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.

110
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.380
The Federation
would not dare go that far.

111
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.130
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be finished.

112
00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.980
We must continue to rely
on negotiation.

113
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.170
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

114
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.530
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?

115
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.170
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.

116
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.280
Our security volunteers
will be no match...

117
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.450
against a battle-hardened
Federation army.

118
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.520
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

119
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.450
- Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship...

120
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:09.610
and there is no trace of theJedi.

121
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.370
They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.

122
00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.840
If they're down here, sir,
we'll find them.

123
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.110
Use caution.
TheseJedi are not to be underestimated.

124
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.080
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

125
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.790
Get down!

126
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.150
Was'n dat?
Hey, wait!

127
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.710
Oh, mooie-mooie,
I love you.

128
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.800
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

129
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.480
I spake.

130
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.640
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

131
00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.510
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

132
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.550
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

133
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.670
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it 'tis.

134
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.550
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

135
00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.510
- Oh, no!
- Stay down!

136
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.190
You saved my again.

137
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.120
- What's this?
- A local.

138
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.670
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.

139
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.030
More?
"More'' did you spake?

140
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.840
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

141
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.030
Is where I grew up.
'Tis a hidden city.

142
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.400
- A city?
- Uh-huh.

143
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.240
Can you take us there?

144
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.480
On second thought, no.

145
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.990
- Not really, no.
- No?

146
00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.160
'Tis embarrassing...

147
00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:52.070
but my afraid
my've been banished.

148
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.160
My forgotten. Da bosses
would do terrible tings to me.

149
00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.190
Terrible tings to me
if me goen back dare.

150
00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.200
- You hear that?
- Yah.

151
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.920
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

152
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.510
If they find us,
they will crush us...

153
00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:12.000
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

154
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.760
Oh.

155
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.870
Yousa point is well seen.

156
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.230
Dis way. Hurry!

157
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.470
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

158
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.400
Ah, my warning you.

159
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.480
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

160
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.800
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.

161
00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.110
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?

162
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.360

Yousa cannot bees hair.

170
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.560
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

171
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:29.360
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.

172
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.920
Wesa no like da Naboo.

173
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.710
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

174
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.640
Day tink day brains so big.

175
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.720
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.

176
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.030
Mesa no tink so.

177
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.900
Day not know of uss-en.

178
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.830
You and the Naboo form
a symbiont circle.

179
00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.180
What happens to one of you will affect
the other. You must understand this.

180
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:58.910
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

181
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.460
Then speed us on our way.

182

Wesa ganna speed yous away.

183
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:06.780

189
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.380
Thank you for your help.
We leave in peace.

190
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.470
Master, what's a bongo?

191
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:27.470

Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

194
00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.300
Any help here would be hot.

195
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:40.390
Master, we're short on time.

196
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.980
We'll need a navigator to get us
through the planet's core.

197
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.990
This Gungan may be of help.

198
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.940
What is to become
of Jar Jar Binks here?

199
00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:55.780
Hisen to be pune-ished.

200
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:57.990
I saved his life.

201
00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:00.500
He owes me
what you call a "life-debt.''

202
00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:04.300
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

203
00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.650
Binks...

204
00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:10.570

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.810

Count me outta dis one.

207
00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.760
Better dead here
than dead in da core.

208
00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:29.880
Yee gods!
What mesa sayin?

209
00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.040
Dis is nutsen.
Oh, gooberfish!

210
00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:53.290
- Why were you banished,Jar Jar?
- It's a longo tale-o...

211
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:58.240
buta a small part of it
would be mesa... clumsy.

212
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.960
- You were banished for being clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

213
00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.400
Mesa caused mabee one two-y
lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.480

Big gooberfish!
Huge-o teeth!

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.480
- There's always a bigger fish.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

218
00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.470
The invasion is on schedule,
my lord.

219
00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.480
I have the senate
bogged down in procedures.

220
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.830
They will have no choice but
to accept your control of the system.

221
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.480
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

222
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.430
Queen Amidala is young and naive.

223
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.870
You will find controlling her
will not be difficult.

224
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.800
Yes, my lord.

225
00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.950
You didn't tell him
about the missing Jedi.

226
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.390
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

227
00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.270
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

228
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.070
Oh, maxi big, da Force.

229
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.870
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

230
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.470
- We're losing power.
- Oh, no!

231
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.340
Wesa dyin' here.

232
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:58.030
-Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet''?

233
00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.980
Monsters out dare.
Leak'n in here.

234
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:05.860
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

235
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.300
Power's back.

236
00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.410
Monster's back!

237
00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.610
Relax.

238
00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.140
You overdid it.

239
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.180
Head for that outcropping.

240
00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.130
Oh, boy.

241
00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.010
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

242
00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.700
Ah, victory.

243
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.730
Dis'n loverly.

244
00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.890
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

245
00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:48.010
The queen and I will sign a treaty that
will legitimize our occupation here.

246
00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:51.180
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

247
00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.610
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

248
00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:58.700
In time, your people's suffering will
persuade you to see our point of view.

249
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.810
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

250
00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.500
Process them.

251
00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.340
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

252
00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.020
Roger, roger.

253
00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.780
We should leave the street,
Your Highness.

254
00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.460
Get their weapons.

255
00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.370
Yousa guys bombad!

256
00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.210
We're ambassadors
for the supreme chancellor.

257
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.130
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

258
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.000
The negotiations
never took place.

259
00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.400
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

260
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.510
They've knocked out
all our communications.

261
00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.840
- Do you have transports?
- In the main hangar. This way.

262
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.560
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

263
00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.070
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

264
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.110
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

265
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.830
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

266
00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.920
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.

267
00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.520
They can't afford to kill her.

268
00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.680
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

269
00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.680
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

270
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.680
My feelings tell me
they will destroy you.

271
00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.070
Our only hope is for the senate
to side with us.

272
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:54.540
Senator Palpatine
will need your help.

273
00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:58.450
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.

274
00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.380
We are brave, Your Highness.

275
00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.620
If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.

276
00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.090
Then I will plead our case
to the senate.

277
00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:08.810
Be careful, Governor.

278
00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:19.360
We'll need to free those pilots.

279
00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:22.370
I'll deal with that.

280
00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:26.680
Halt.

281
00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:28.400
I'm ambassador
to the supreme chancellor.

282
00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:30.040
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

283
00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:33.240
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

284
00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.880
Coruscant?
Uh, that doesn't compute.

285
00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:37.840
Uh, wait.
Uh, you're under arrest.

286
00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:44.240
Come on. Move!

287
00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:50.320
Go!

288
00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:18.000
Now, stay here
and keep out of trouble.

289
00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:23.720
Hello, boyos.

290
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:31.370
There's the blockade.

291
00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:42.930
The shield generator's been hit!

292
00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:52.600
How wude!

293
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.720
We're losing droids fast.

294
00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.040
If we can't get the shield generator
fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.

295
00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:10.320
The shields are gone.

296
00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:19.400
The power's back!

297
00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:25.400
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

298
00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:28.000
Deflector shields up at maximum.

299
00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:40.760
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

300
00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:43.640
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

301
00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:45.840
Here, Master.
Tatooine.

302
00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:47.560
It's small, out of the way, poor.

303
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:49.360
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.

304
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.290
How can you be sure?

305
00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:53.240
It's controlled by the Hutts.

306
00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:56.040
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

307
00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:58.360
- If they discovered her--
- It'd be no different than landing...

308
00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.280
on a system controlled
by the Federation...

309
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.390
except that the Hutts
aren't looking for her...

310
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.510
which gives us the advantage.

311
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.680
And Queen Amidala,
has she signed the treaty?

312
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.270
She has disappeared, my lord.

313
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:19.390
One Naboo cruiser
got past the blockade.

314
00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.310
I want that treaty signed.

315
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:24.390
My lord...

316
00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:26.940
it's impossible to locate the ship.

317
00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:29.190
It's out of our range.

318
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:31.460
Not for a Sith.

319
00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:33.830
This is my apprentice...

320
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:35.780
Darth Maul.

321
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:40.220
He will find your lost ship.

322
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:46.580
This is getting out of hand.

323
00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.660
Now there are two of them.

324
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.660
We should not
have made this bargain.

325
00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:00.130
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

326
00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:03.010
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

327
00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.340
It is to be commended.
What is its number?

328
00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.940
R2-D2, Your Highness.

329
00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:12.410
Thank you, R2-D2.

330
00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:17.410
Padmé.

331
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.940
Clean this droid up
as best you can.

332
00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.940
It deserves our gratitude.

333
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.140
Continue, Captain.

334
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.730
Your Highness,
with your permission...

335
00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.500
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

336
00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.820
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

337
00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.410
I do not agree
with the Jedi on this.

338
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.340
You must trust my judgment,
Your Highness.

339
00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.260
Hello.

340
00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.210
Sorry. Husa are yousa?

341
00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:52.690
I'm Padmé.

342
00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.690
Mesa Jar Jar Binks.

343
00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.730
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

344
00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.380
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

345
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:07.020
Mesa day starten pitty okeyday
witda brisky morning munchen.

346
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.810
Den boom!
Getten berry scared...

347
00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:13.090
and grabben dat Jedi, and pow--

348
00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.810
Mesa getten
berry, berry scared.

349
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:25.820
- That's it-- Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

350
00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.850
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

351
00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:49.090
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

352
00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:51.570
That'll complicate things.
Be wary.

353
00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:54.680
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.
- I feel it also, Master.

354
00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.770
Don't let them send
any transmissions.

355
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:04.920
The sun doen murder to mesa skin.

356
00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:06.480
Wait!

357
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:08.880
Wait.

358
00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:14.920
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

359
00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:18.640
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

360
00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.750
The spaceport
is not going to be pleasant.

361
00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.920
The queen wishes it.

362
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.870
She's curious about the planet.

363
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.270
This is not a good idea.
Stay close to me.

364
00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.240
Moisture farms,
for the most part.

365
00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:51.030
Some indigenous tribes
and scavengers.

366
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.960
The few spaceports like this one...

367
00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.280
are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.

368
00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.230
Like us.

369
00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.190
Dissen berry, berry bad.

370
00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.160
Icky, icky goo!

371
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.950
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

372
00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.240
Good day to you.

373
00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.160
What do you want?

374
00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.240
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

375
00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:36.240
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.

376
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.760
Boy, get in here now!

377
00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.680
My droid has a readout of what I need.

378
00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.790
What took you so long?

379
00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.920
I was cleaning the fan switches.

380
00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.680
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

381
00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.920
So, let me take thee out back, huh?

382
00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.840
We'll find what you need.

383
00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.880
Don't touch anything.

384
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.550
- Are you an angel?
- What?

385
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.230
An angel. I heard the deep space
pilots talk about them.

386
00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.110
They're the most beautiful
creatures in the universe.

387
00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.710
They live on the moons of lego,
I think.

388
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:25.000
You're a funny little boy.
How do you know so much?

389
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.790
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.

390
00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:33.030
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

391
00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:36.940
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

392
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:39.270
How long have you been here?

393
00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:43.220
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.

394
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:45.940
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt...

395
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:48.660
but she lost us
betting on the Podraces.

396
00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:50.510
You're a slave?

397
00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:54.590
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

398
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:58.300
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

399
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:11.710
- I got ya.
- Hey!

400
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:13.500
Hit the nose.

401
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:21.380
A T-14 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

402
00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:24.020
I'm the only one hereabouts
who has one.

403
00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:27.510
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think, huh.

404
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:30.430
Saying of which...

405
00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:32.820
how's thee gonna pay
for all this, huh?

406
00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.900
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

407
00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.770
Republic credits?

408
00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.700
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

409
00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:42.810
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

410
00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:46.410
- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.

411
00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.290
No, they won't!

412
00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:52.410
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?

413
00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:56.610
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

414
00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:00.650
No money, no parts, no deal.

415
00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:05.140
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

416
00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:15.810
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

417
00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.220
We're leaving.Jar Jar.

418
00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:26.170
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

419
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.050
I was glad to meet you too.

420
00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:40.460
Outlanders.
They think we know nothing.

421
00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:42.410
They seemed nice to me.

422
00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:44.370
Clean the racks.

423
00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:45.770
Then you can go home.

424
00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:47.620
Yippee!

425
00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.690
And you're sure there's
nothing left on board?

426
00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:57.610
A few containers of supplies.

427
00:33:57.730 --> 00:34:00.640
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with...

428
00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:03.000
not in the amount
you're talking about.

429
00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:05.930
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

430
00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:07.370
I'll check back later.

431
00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:09.720
Noah gain. Noah gain.

432
00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:12.570
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

433
00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:15.040
Wesa be wobbed un crunched.

434
00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:18.200
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

435
00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.190
Are you going to pay for that?

436
00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.920
It costs seven wupiupi.

437
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.270
Oops.

438
00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.400
Is this yours?

439
00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.190
Who, mesa--

440
00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.240
Careful, Sebulba.

441
00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.270
He's a big-time outlander.

442
00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.790
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

443
00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:07.630
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

444
00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.670
If you weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.

445
00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.080
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.

446
00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.150
- Hi.
- Hi there.

447
00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.000
Your buddy here was
about to be turned into orange goo.

448
00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.920
He picked a fight with a Dug...

449
00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.430
an especially dangerous Dug
called Sebulba.

450
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.000
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

451
00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.950
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

452
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.880
Thanks, my young friend.

453
00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.880
But mesa doen nutten!

454
00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.510
This storm will slow them down.

455
00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.070
Looks pretty bad.

456
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.750
- Panaka.
- Receiving a message from home.

457
00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.600
We'll be right there.

458
00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.830
Here, you'll like these pallies.

459
00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.430
- Here.
- Thank you.

460
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.750
My bones are aching.

461
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:14.230
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

462
00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:17.070
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

463
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:19.660
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

464
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:22.060
You'll never reach
the outskirts in time.

465
00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.890
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

466
00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.370
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.

467
00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:43.640
Mom!

468
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:47.320
- Mom, I'm home!
- Ah, dissen cosy.

469
00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:49.720
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

470
00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:53.230
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

471
00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.640
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

472
00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.640
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.

473
00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:10.160
Isn't he great?
He's not finished yet.

474
00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.510
He's wonderful.

475
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.360
You really like him?

476
00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.280
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.

477
00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.750
Where is everybody?

478
00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.990
Whoops.

479
00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:28.180
Oh, hello.

480
00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.450
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

481
00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.380
How might I serve you?

482
00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.170
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

483
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.690
When the storm is over, I'll show you
my racer. I'm building a Podracer.

484
00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:43.450
I'm not sure this floor
is entirely stable.

485
00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:46.650
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.

486
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.650
R2-D2.
A pleasure to meet you.

487
00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.690
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

488
00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:59.290
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, " naked''?

489
00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:04.020
My parts are showing?
My goodness!

490
00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.810
The death toll is catastrophic.

491
00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:13.200
We must bow to their wishes.

492
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.280
You must contact me.

493
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.960
It's a trick.
Send no reply.

494
00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.990
Send no transmissions of any kind.

495
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.950
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

496
00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.870
What if it is true,
and the people are dying?

497
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.360
Either way,
we're running out of time.

498
00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:46.490
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

499
00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:49.280
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

500
00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:51.210
Move against the Jedi first.

501
00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:53.920
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo...

502
00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:55.850
to sign the treaty.

503
00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:58.040
At last we will reveal ourselves
to the Jedi.

504
00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:00.480
At last we will have revenge.

505
00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:03.360
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

506
00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:05.760
They will be no match for you.

507
00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:14.280
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

508
00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:18.210
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

509
00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:21.690
- Any attempt to escape--
- And they blow you up!

510
00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:24.080
How wude!

511
00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:26.520
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

512
00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:28.450
The Republic's antislavery laws--

513
00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:30.800
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

514
00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:33.000
We must survive on our own.

515
00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:35.400
Xcuse me.

516
00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:39.840
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

517
00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.690
They have Podracing
on Malastare.

518
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:44.400
Very fast, very dangerous.

519
00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:46.970
I'm the only human who can do it.

520
00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:49.970
You must have Jedi reflexes
if you race pods.

521
00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:52.370
Don't do that again.

522
00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:00.080
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

523
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:05.680
- What makes you think that?
- I saw your laser sword.

524
00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:08.560
Only Jedis carry
that kind of weapon.

525
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:11.680
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

526
00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:13.370
I don't think so.

527
00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:15.560
No one can kill a Jedi.

528
00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:18.330
I wish that were so.

529
00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:20.410
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

530
00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:23.570
I came back here
and freed all the slaves.

531
00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:26.890
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

532
00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:31.160
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

533
00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:38.490
I can see there's
no fooling you, Anakin.

534
00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:41.490
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic...

535
00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:43.520
on a very important mission.

536
00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:46.560
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?

537
00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:50.160
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.

538
00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:54.440
I can help.
I can fix anything.

539
00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:56.000
I believe you can.

540
00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:58.800
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

541
00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:01.520
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

542
00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:05.040
These junk dealers
must have a weakness of some kind.

543
00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:09.290
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

544
00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:10.600
Podracing.

545
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:13.530
Greed can be a powerful ally.

546
00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:16.400
I built a racer.
It's the fastest ever.

547
00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:18.730
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.

548
00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:20.730
You could enter my pod.

549
00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:24.560
- Anakin, Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

550
00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:26.490
You could make him think
it was yours...

551
00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:28.730
and get him
to let me pilot it for you.

552
00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:30.360
I don't want you to race.
It's awful.

553
00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:32.880
I die every time
Watto makes you do it.

554
00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:35.050
But, Mom, I love it.

555
00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:38.560
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

556
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:40.880
Anakin.

557
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.640
Your mother's right.

558
00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.720
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

559
00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.750
No.

560
00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:59.080
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

561
00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:06.470
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

562
00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.430
We'll find some other way.

563
00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.150
There is no other way.

564
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:17.420
I may not like it,
but he can help you.

565
00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:20.070
He was meant to help you.

566
00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:34.870
Are you sure about this?

567
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:37.500
Trusting our fate
to a boy we hardly know?

568
00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:39.590
The queen will not approve.

569
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:41.510
The queen doesn't need to know.

570
00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:44.150
Well, I don't approve.

571
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:47.740
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.

572
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:49.430
How can you do this?

573
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:52.700
Not on the Republic credits,
I think.

574
00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:54.900
My ship will be the entry fee.

575
00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:57.030
Not bad!

576
00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:59.980
Not bad, huh?
Nubian, huh?

577
00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:03.260
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

578
00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:05.780
What would the boy ride?

579
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:09.300
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It would take some long time to fix it.

580
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:11.660
It wasn't my fault.
Really.

581
00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:13.350
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

582
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:16.700
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

583
00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:20.140
That you did.

584
00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:22.930
The boy's good.
No doubts there, huh?

585
00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:25.450
I have acquired a pod
in a game of chance.

586
00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:27.170
The fastest ever built.

587
00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:32.220
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

588
00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:37.500
So, you supply the pod
and the entry fee...

589
00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:38.950
and I supply the boy.

590
00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:42.780
We split the winnings 50-50,
I think, huh?

591
00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:44.710
If it's going to be 50-50...

592
00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:47.340
I suggest you front the cash
for the entry.

593
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:49.430
If we win...

594
00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:53.180
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

595
00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:56.380
And if we lose,
you keep my ship.

596
00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:00.100
Either way, you win.

597
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:06.940
Deal!

598
00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:16.020
Your friend
is a foolish one, methinks.

599
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:26.470
What if this plan fails, Master?

600
00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:29.180
We could be stuck here
a very long time.

601
00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:31.740
Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help...

602
00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:35.100
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

603
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:37.110
And...

604
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:39.030
there's something about this boy.

605
00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:47.820
You should be very proud of your son.

606
00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:50.780
He gives without any thought
of reward.

607
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:53.660
He knows nothing of greed.

608
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:54.830
He has--

609
00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:57.590
He has special powers.

610
00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:00.460
Yes.

611
00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:03.100
He can see things
before they happen.

612
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:05.900
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

613
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:07.830
It's a Jedi trait.

614
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:10.620
He deserves better
than a slave's life.

615
00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:13.980
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

616
00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:19.900
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

617
00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:21.690
Who was his father?

618
00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.130
There was no father.

619
00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:30.740
I carried him,
I gave birth, I raised him.

620
00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.970
I can't explain what happened.

621
00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.300
Can you help him?

622
00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:39.220
I don't know.

623
00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:45.090
I didn't actually come here
to free slaves.

624
00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:59.500
Wow, a real astro droid!

625
00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:04.930
- How do you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

626
00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:07.880
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

627
00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:09.650
With this?

628
00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:12.410
You're such a joker, Ani.

629
00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:15.600
- You've been working on that for years.
- It's never gonna run.

630
00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:17.800
Come on.
Let's go and play ball.

631
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:21.080
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

632
00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:31.570
Keep away from
those energy binders.

633
00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:35.000
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

634
00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:36.450
Okay.

635
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:42.440
My tongue is fat.

636
00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:45.530
My tongue-- Wrench.

637
00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:48.210
Where is de wrench?
Oh, dare it is.

638
00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:53.970
I'm stuck.

639
00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:57.920
You know, I find that Jar Jar creature
to be a little odd.

640
00:46:59.690 --> 00:47:02.410
You don't even know
if this thing's gonna run.

641
00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:04.520
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

642
00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:06.770
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

643
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:08.850
Come on, Kitster.
Let's move away.

644
00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:11.090
My mouth.

645
00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:12.480
Ani, I'm stuck.

646
00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:19.560
My tongue is fat.

647
00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:22.520
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.

648
00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:26.610
Thank you.

649
00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:28.080
Go.

650
00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:45.480
It's working!
It's working!

651
00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:58.080
Stay still, Ani.
Let me clean this cut.

652
00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:01.960
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

653
00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:03.890
Most of them.

654
00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:05.890
Has anyone been to 'em all?

655
00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:08.680
Not likely.

656
00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:11.890
I wanna be the first one
to see 'em all.

657
00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:15.330
Ani, bedtime!

658
00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:18.090
There we are.
Good as new.

659
00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:20.960
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

660
00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:24.370
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

661
00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:25.970
Go on.

662
00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:27.970
You have a big day tomorrow.

663
00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:29.890
Sleep well, Ani.

664
00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:34.440
- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, Master?

665
00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:37.160
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

666
00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:38.930
Wait a minute.

667
00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:42.450
I need a midi-chlorian count.

668
00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:47.800
The reading is off the chart.

669
00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:49.730
Over 20,000.

670
00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:53.320
Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.

671
00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:55.170
No Jedi has.

672
00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:57.250
What does that mean?

673
00:48:58.090 --> 00:48:59.650
I'm not sure.

674
00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:09.480
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

675
00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:11.280
Patience, my blue friend.

676
00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:13.560
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.

677
00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:15.410
And we'll be far away from here.

678
00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:19.410
Not if your ship belongs to me,
I think, huh?

679
00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:22.760
I warn you, no funny business.

680
00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:25.880
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrongo.

681
00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:28.360
I have great faith in the boy.

682
00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.520
He's a credit to your race...

683
00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.710
but Sebulba there
is going to win, I think.

684
00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.430
Oh, no!

685
00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.190
Why do you think that?

686
00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.120
He always wins!

687
00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.390
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

688
00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:53.750
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

689
00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:57.680
I'll wager my new racing pod
against, say...

690
00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:59.600
the boy and his mother.

691
00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:03.270
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

692
00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.830
The boy, then.

693
00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.190
We'll let fate decide, huh?

694
00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:17.600
I just happen to have
a chance cube here.

695
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.630
Blue, it's the boy.

696
00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:21.830
Red...

697
00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:24.760
his mother.

698
00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:36.390
You won this small toss,
outlander...

699
00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:38.560
but you won't win the race!

700
00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:40.670
So it makes little difference!

701
00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:54.790
Better stop your friend's betting
or I'll end up owning him too.

702
00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.790
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

703
00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:02.240
Good morning.

704
00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.920
Oh, my.
Space travel sounds rather perilous.

705
00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:12.750
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

706
00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:16.110
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

707
00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.280
Do what?

708
00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.310
Finish the race, of course.

709
00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:22.110
You've never won a race?

710
00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.830
Well, not exactly.

711
00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:26.870
Not even finished?

712
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.350
Kitster's right.
I will this time.

713
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:31.430
Of course you will.

714
00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:01.620
That's absolutely right.

715
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:06.580
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.

716
00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:10.170
I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.

717
00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:14.900
I see Ben Quadinaros
from the Tund System.

718
00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:22.690
Two-time winner Boles Roor.

719
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:26.860
Sebulba!

720
00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:39.820
And in the front row,
nearside pole position...

721
00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:41.850
Mawhonic!

722
00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:44.980
A hearty hello...

723
00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:48.650
to Clegg Holdfast
and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!

724
00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:54.420
And back again,
it's the mighty Dud Bolt...

725
00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:58.930
with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327.

726
00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:04.330
And hoping for a big win today...

727
00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:08.680
Ody Mandrell,
with his record-setting pit droid team.

728
00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:16.490
And a late entry,
young Anakin Skywalker...

729
00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:17.840
a local boy.

730
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:22.600
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.

731
00:54:42.010 --> 00:54:43.490
Be safe.

732
00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:45.840
I will, Mom. I promise.

733
00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:03.930
You won't walk away from this one...

734
00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:06.200
you slave scum.

735
00:55:06.330 --> 00:55:09.450
Don't count on it, slime ball.

736
00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:11.840
You're bantha fodder!

737
00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:18.370
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

738
00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:20.050
Right.

739
00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:26.520
Remember, concentrate
on the moment.

740
00:55:26.650 --> 00:55:30.240
Feel, don't think.
Use your instincts.

741
00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.920
I will.

742
00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:34.160
May the Force be with you.

743
00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:44.670
Jabba the Hutt.

744
00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:58.710
Welcome.

745
00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:02.760
Begin the race!

746
00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:15.920
Hey, looks like
they're clearing the grid.

747
00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:18.880
- Is he nervous?
- He's fine.

748
00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:23.190
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not--

749
00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:26.070
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.

750
00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:28.320
You should too.

751
00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:30.430
You assume too much.

752
00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:33.470
Start your engines.

753
00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:14.360
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

754
00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:34.790
Oh, no!

755
00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:43.350
Wait.
Little Skywalker has stalled.

756
00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:57.440
It looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.

757
00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:00.190
Come on, Ani!

758
00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:07.870
And there goes Skywalker!

759
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.400
Go, Ani, go!

760
00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.560
He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.

761
00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.440
Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out...

762
00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:27.760
on the canyon dune turn.

763
00:59:38.530 --> 00:59:42.080
There goes Quadinaros'
power coupling.

764
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:10.810
Oh, no!

765
01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:17.210
Where is Master Anakin?

766
01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:22.450
Look. Here he comes.

767
01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:27.440
It looks like Skywalker
is moving up in the field.

768
01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:29.640
Yay! Yippee!

769
01:00:36.850 --> 01:00:40.290
He has to complete
two more circuits? Oh, dear.

770
01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:46.930
Skywalker's
spinning out of control!

771
01:02:42.490 --> 01:02:46.280
I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!

772
01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:54.690
Here he comes!

773
01:02:54.810 --> 01:02:57.800
At the start of the third and final lap,
Sebulba's in the lead...

774
01:02:57.930 --> 01:03:00.320
followed closely by Skywalker!

775
01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:01.280
Go, Ani!

776
01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:29.440
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!

777
01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:51.570
It's Skywalker!

778
01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:53.760
Sebulba!

779
01:03:53.890 --> 01:03:57.960
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

780
01:03:58.090 --> 01:03:59.760
Did he crash-ed?

781
01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:42.120
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

782
01:05:32.970 --> 01:05:34.560
He's catching Sebulba!

783
01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:38.040
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

784
01:06:07.170 --> 01:06:09.440
That little human being
is out of his mind!

785
01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:11.630
They're side by side!

786
01:06:39.110 --> 01:06:40.910
- Yippee!
- Yay!

787
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:46.590
I can't believe it.

788
01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:48.540
The crowds are going nuts!

2
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.490
- Captain.
- Yes, sir?

3
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.660
Tell them we wish
to board at once.

4
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.450
With all due respect...

5
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.650
the ambassadors for the supreme
chancellor wish to board immediately.

6
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.580
Yes, of course.

7
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.660
As you know,
our blockade is perfectly legal...

8
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.690
and we'd be happy
to receive the ambassadors.

9
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.770
I'm TC-14 at your service.

10
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.700
This way, please.

11
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.490
We are greatly honoured
by your visit, Ambassadors.

12
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.420
Make yourselves comfortable.

13
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.770
My master
will be with you shortly.

14
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.690
I have a bad feeling about this.

15
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.690
- I don't sense anything.
- It's not about the mission, Master.

16
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.560
It's something elsewhere, elusive.

17
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.960
Don't centre on your anxieties,
Obi-Wan.

18
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.070
Keep your concentration here and now,
where it belongs.

19
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.920
But Master Yoda said
I should be mindful of the future.

20
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.950
But not at the expense
of the moment.

21
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.880
Be mindful of the living Force,
young Padawan.

22
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.830
Yes, Master.

23
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.430
How do you think this trade viceroy
will deal with the chancellor's demands?

24
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.600
These Federation types are cowards.

25
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.440
The negotiations will be short.

26
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.710
What? What did you say?

27
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.670
The ambassadors are Jedi knights,
I believe.

28
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.550
I knew it.

29
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.830
They're here to force a settlement.

30
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.080
Distract them.
I will contact Lord Sidious.

31
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.710
Are you brain-dead?

32
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.560
I'm not going in there
with two Jedi.

33
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.510
Send a droid.

34
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.560
Is it in their nature
to make us wait this long?

35
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.870
No. I sense
an unusual amount of fear...

36
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.030
for something as trivial
as this trade dispute.

37
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.310
What is it?

38
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.990
This scheme of yours has failed,
Lord Sidious.

39
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.500
The blockade is finished.
We dare not go against these Jedi.

40
00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.230
Viceroy, I don't want
this stunted slime in my sight again.

41
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.430
This turn of events is unfortunate.
We must accelerate our plans.

42
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.980
Begin landing your troops.

43
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.660
My lord, is that legal?

44
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.980
I will make it legal.

45
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.290
And the Jedi?

46
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.800
The chancellor should never have
brought them into this.

47
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.600
Kill them immediately.

48
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.850
Yes, my lord.
As you wish.

49
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.370
Captain, look!

50
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.770
Shields--

51
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.930
Sorry.

52
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.410
Dioxis.

53
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.560
They must be dead by now.

54
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.250
Destroy what's left of them.

55
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.320
Oh! Excuse me.

56
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.270
-Check it out, Corporal. We'll cover you.
-Roger, roger.

57
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.790
Uh-oh. Blast them.

58
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.800
What is going on down there?

59
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.800
We lost the transmission, sir.

60
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.000
Have you ever encountered
a Jedi knight before, sir?

61
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.950
Well, no, but I don't--
Seal off the bridge.

62
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.670
- Yes, sir.
- That won't be enough, sir.

63
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.680
I want droidekas
up here at once!

64
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.230
We will not survive this.

65
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.670
Close the blast doors!

66
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.110
That will hold them.

67
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.830
They are still coming through.

68
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.790
This is impossible!

69
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.840
Where are those droidekas?

70
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.030
Master! Destroyers!

71
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.520
They have shield generators!

72
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.510
It's a standoff.
Let's go.

73
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.910
They're no match for droidekas.

74
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.630
Sir!

75
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.320
They've gone up
the ventilation shaft.

76
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.320
- Battle droids.
- It's an invasion army.

77
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.560
This is an odd play
for the Trade Federation.

78
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.640
We've got to warn the Naboo
and contact Chancellor Valorum.

79
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.240
Let's split up.

80
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.430
Stow aboard separate ships
and meet down on the planet.

81
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.310
You were right
about one thing, Master.

82
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.760
The negotiations were short.

83
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.190
Sir, a transmission
from the planet.

84
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.310
It's Queen Amidala herself.

85
00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.750
At last we are getting results.

86
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.960
Again you come before us,
Your Highness.

87
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.040
You will not be so pleased when you hear
what I have to say, Viceroy.

88
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.710
Your trade boycott
of our planet has ended.

89
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.270
I was not aware of such failure.

90
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.990
I have word that the chancellor's
ambassadors are with you now...

91
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.710
and that you have been commanded
to reach settlement.

92
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.990
I know nothing
of any ambassadors.

93
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.390
You must be mistaken.

94
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.420
Beware, Viceroy.

95
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:11.140
The Federation
has gone too far this time.

96
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:15.150
We would never do anything
without the approval of the senate.

97
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:17.660
You assume too much.

98
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.110
We will see.

99
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.500
- She's right. The senate will never--
- It's too late now.

100
00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.460
- Do you think she suspects an attack?
- I don't know.

101
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.740
But we must move quickly to disrupt
all communications down there.

102
00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.630
Negotiations haven't started
because the ambassadors aren't there?

103
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.820
How could that be true?

104
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:47.100
I have assurances from the chancellor
his ambassadors did arrive.

105
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:50.830
It must-- handiwork--
negotiate-- ambassadors--

106
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.460
- nobody would--
- Senator Palpatine.

107
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.390
What's happening?

108
00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.310
Check the transmission generator.

109
00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:02.060
A communications disruption
can mean only one thing: invasion.

110
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.380
The Federation
would not dare go that far.

111
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.130
The senate would revoke their trade
franchise, and they'd be finished.

112
00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.980
We must continue to rely
on negotiation.

113
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.170
Negotiation?
We've lost all communications.

114
00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.530
And where are
the chancellor's ambassadors?

115
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.170
This is a dangerous situation,
Your Highness.

116
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.280
Our security volunteers
will be no match...

117
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.450
against a battle-hardened
Federation army.

118
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.520
I will not condone a course of action
that will lead us to war.

119
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.450
- Yes, Viceroy?
- Captain, we've searched the ship...

120
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:09.610
and there is no trace of theJedi.

121
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.370
They may have gotten on
one of your landing craft.

122
00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.840
If they're down here, sir,
we'll find them.

123
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.110
Use caution.
TheseJedi are not to be underestimated.

124
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.080
- Oh, no!
- Get away! Get out of here!

125
00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.790
Get down!

126
00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.150
Was'n dat?
Hey, wait!

127
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.710
Oh, mooie-mooie,
I love you.

128
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.800
You almost got us killed.
Are you brainless?

129
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.480
I spake.

130
00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.640
The ability to speak
does not make you intelligent.

131
00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.510
- Now, get out of here.
- No, no, mesa stay.

132
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.550
Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks.
Mesa your humble servant.

133
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.670
- That won't be necessary.
- Oh, but it 'tis.

134
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.550
'Tis demanded by the gods, it 'tis.

135
00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.510
- Oh, no!
- Stay down!

136
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:20.190
You saved my again.

137
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.120
- What's this?
- A local.

138
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.670
Let's get out of here
before more droids show up.

139
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.030
More?
"More'' did you spake?

140
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:32.840
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest
safest place would be Gunga City.

141
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.030
Is where I grew up.
'Tis a hidden city.

142
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.400
- A city?
- Uh-huh.

143
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.240
Can you take us there?

144
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.480
On second thought, no.

145
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.990
- Not really, no.
- No?

146
00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.160
'Tis embarrassing...

147
00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:52.070
but my afraid
my've been banished.

148
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.160
My forgotten. Da bosses
would do terrible tings to me.

149
00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.190
Terrible tings to me
if me goen back dare.

150
00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.200
- You hear that?
- Yah.

151
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.920
That is the sound of a thousand
terrible things heading this way.

152
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.510
If they find us,
they will crush us...

153
00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:12.000
grind us into tiny pieces
and blast us into oblivion.

154
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.760
Oh.

155
00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.870
Yousa point is well seen.

156
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.230
Dis way. Hurry!

157
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.470
- How much further?
- Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

158
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.400
Ah, my warning you.

159
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.480
Gungans no liken outsiders,
so don't spect a warm welcome.

160
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.800
Don't worry. This hasn't been
our day for warm welcomes.

161
00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.110
Yousa follow me now, okeyday?

162
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.360
So good bein home!

163
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.550
Hey, yousa.
Stopa dare.

164
00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.910
Heyo-dales, Cap'n Tarpals.

165
00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.840
Mesa back.

166
00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.760
Noah gain,Jar Jar.
Yousa goen tada bosses.

167
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.390
Yousa in big dudu dis time.

168
00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.470
How wude.

169
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.070
Yousa cannot bees hair.

170
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.560
Dis army of Mackineeks
up dare is new weesong.

171
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:29.360
A droid army is about to attack
the Naboo. We must warn them.

172
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.920
Wesa no like da Naboo.

173
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.710
Da Naboo tink day so smarty.

174
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.640
Day tink day brains so big.

175
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.720
Once those droids take control of the
surface, they will take control of you.

176
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.030
Mesa no tink so.

177
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:47.900
Day not know of uss-en.

178
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:50.830
You and the Naboo form
a symbiont circle.

179
00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:54.180
What happens to one of you will affect
the other. You must understand this.

180
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:58.910
Wesa no carrrre-nn about da Naboo.

181
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:01.460
Then speed us on our way.

182
00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:03.980
Wesa ganna speed yous away.

183
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:06.780
We could use a transport.

184
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:09.630
Wesa give yousa una bongo.

185
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.710
Da speediest way tooda Naboo...

186
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:17.350
'tis goen through the planet core.

187
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.270
Now...

188
00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.110
go.

189
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.380
Thank you for your help.
We leave in peace.

190
00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:25.470
Master, what's a bongo?

191
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:27.470
A transport, I hope.

192
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.580
Deysa setten yousa up.

193
00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:33.180
Goen through da planet core?
Bad bombin'.

194
00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.300
Any help here would be hot.

195
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:40.390
Master, we're short on time.

196
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.980
We'll need a navigator to get us
through the planet's core.

197
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.990
This Gungan may be of help.

198
00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.940
What is to become
of Jar Jar Binks here?

199
00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:55.780
Hisen to be pune-ished.

200
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:57.990
I saved his life.

201
00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:00.500
He owes me
what you call a "life-debt.''

202
00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:04.300
Your gods demand
that his life belongs to me now.

203
00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.650
Binks...

204
00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:10.570
yousa havena liveplay
with thisen hisen?

205
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.810
Begone wit him!

206
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.650
Count me outta dis one.

207
00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.760
Better dead here
than dead in da core.

208
00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:29.880
Yee gods!
What mesa sayin?

209
00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:50.040
Dis is nutsen.
Oh, gooberfish!

210
00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:53.290
- Why were you banished,Jar Jar?
- It's a longo tale-o...

211
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:58.240
buta a small part of it
would be mesa... clumsy.

212
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.960
- You were banished for being clumsy?
- Yousa might'n be sayin dat.

213
00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.400
Mesa caused mabee one two-y
lettle bitty axadentes, huh?

214
00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.480
Yud-say boom da gasser...

215
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.270
den crashin der boss's heyblibber,
den banished.

216
00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.230
Big gooberfish!
Huge-o teeth!

217
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.480
- There's always a bigger fish.
- Mesa tink we goen back now.

218
00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.470
The invasion is on schedule,
my lord.

219
00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.480
I have the senate
bogged down in procedures.

220
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.830
They will have no choice but
to accept your control of the system.

221
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.480
The queen has great faith
that the senate will side with her.

222
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.430
Queen Amidala is young and naive.

223
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.870
You will find controlling her
will not be difficult.

224
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.800
Yes, my lord.

225
00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.950
You didn't tell him
about the missing Jedi.

226
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.390
No need to report that to him
until we have something to report.

227
00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:38.270
- Where wesa goin?
- Don't worry. The Force will guide us.

228
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.070
Oh, maxi big, da Force.

229
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.870
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

230
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.470
- We're losing power.
- Oh, no!

231
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.340
Wesa dyin' here.

232
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:58.030
-Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.
- What "yet''?

233
00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.980
Monsters out dare.
Leak'n in here.

234
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:05.860
All sink'n and no power?
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?

235
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.300
Power's back.

236
00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.410
Monster's back!

237
00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.610
Relax.

238
00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.140
You overdid it.

239
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.180
Head for that outcropping.

240
00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.130
Oh, boy.

241
00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.010
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

242
00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.700
Ah, victory.

243
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.730
Dis'n loverly.

244
00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:43.890
How will you explain this invasion
to the senate?

245
00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:48.010
The queen and I will sign a treaty that
will legitimize our occupation here.

246
00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:51.180
I have assurances
it will be ratified by the senate.

247
00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.610
- I will not cooperate.
- Now, now, Your Highness.

248
00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:58.700
In time, your people's suffering will
persuade you to see our point of view.

249
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.810
- Commander.
- Yes, sir.

250
00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.500
Process them.

251
00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.340
Captain, take them to Camp 4.

252
00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.020
Roger, roger.

253
00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.780
We should leave the street,
Your Highness.

254
00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:03.460
Get their weapons.

255
00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.370
Yousa guys bombad!

256
00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.210
We're ambassadors
for the supreme chancellor.

257
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.130
Your negotiations seemed
to have failed, Ambassador.

258
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.000
The negotiations
never took place.

259
00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.400
It's urgent that we make contact
with the Republic.

260
00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.510
They've knocked out
all our communications.

261
00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.840
- Do you have transports?
- In the main hangar. This way.

262
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.560
- There are too many of them.
- That won't be a problem.

263
00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.070
Your Highness, under the circumstances,
I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.

264
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.110
Thank you, Ambassador,
but my place is with my people.

265
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.830
- They will kill you if you stay.
- They wouldn't dare.

266
00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.920
They need her to sign a treaty
to make this invasion legal.

267
00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.520
They can't afford to kill her.

268
00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.680
There is something else behind all this,
Your Highness.

269
00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.680
There's no logic
in the Federation's move here.

270
00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.680
My feelings tell me
they will destroy you.

271
00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.070
Our only hope is for the senate
to side with us.

272
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:54.540
Senator Palpatine
will need your help.

273
00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:58.450
Either choice presents great danger...
to us all.

274
00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.380
We are brave, Your Highness.

275
00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.620
If you are to leave,
Your Highness, it must be now.

276
00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.090
Then I will plead our case
to the senate.

277
00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:08.810
Be careful, Governor.

278
00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:19.360
We'll need to free those pilots.

279
00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:22.370
I'll deal with that.

280
00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:26.680
Halt.

281
00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:28.400
I'm ambassador
to the supreme chancellor.

282
00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:30.040
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

283
00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:33.240
- Where are you taking them?
- To Coruscant.

284
00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.880
Coruscant?
Uh, that doesn't compute.

285
00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:37.840
Uh, wait.
Uh, you're under arrest.

286
00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:44.240
Come on. Move!

287
00:23:49.410 --> 00:23:50.320
Go!

288
00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:18.000
Now, stay here
and keep out of trouble.

289
00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:23.720
Hello, boyos.

290
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:31.370
There's the blockade.

291
00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:42.930
The shield generator's been hit!

292
00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:52.600
How wude!

293
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.720
We're losing droids fast.

294
00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:07.040
If we can't get the shield generator
fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.

295
00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:10.320
The shields are gone.

296
00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:19.400
The power's back!

297
00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:25.400
That little droid did it.
He bypassed the main power drive.

298
00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:28.000
Deflector shields up at maximum.

299
00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:40.760
There's not enough power to get us
to Coruscant. The hyperdrive is leaking.

300
00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:43.640
We'll have to land somewhere
to refuel and repair the ship.

301
00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:45.840
Here, Master.
Tatooine.

302
00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:47.560
It's small, out of the way, poor.

303
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:49.360
The Trade Federation
have no presence there.

304
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:51.290
How can you be sure?

305
00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:53.240
It's controlled by the Hutts.

306
00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:56.040
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.
The Hutts are gangsters.

307
00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:58.360
- If they discovered her--
- It'd be no different than landing...

308
00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.280
on a system controlled
by the Federation...

309
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.390
except that the Hutts
aren't looking for her...

310
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.510
which gives us the advantage.

311
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.680
And Queen Amidala,
has she signed the treaty?

312
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.270
She has disappeared, my lord.

313
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:19.390
One Naboo cruiser
got past the blockade.

314
00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.310
I want that treaty signed.

315
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:24.390
My lord...

316
00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:26.940
it's impossible to locate the ship.

317
00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:29.190
It's out of our range.

318
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:31.460
Not for a Sith.

319
00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:33.830
This is my apprentice...

320
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:35.780
Darth Maul.

321
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:40.220
He will find your lost ship.

322
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:46.580
This is getting out of hand.

323
00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:48.660
Now there are two of them.

324
00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.660
We should not
have made this bargain.

325
00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:00.130
An extremely well-put-together
little droid, Your Highness.

326
00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:03.010
Without a doubt, it saved the ship,
as well as our lives.

327
00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.340
It is to be commended.
What is its number?

328
00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.940
R2-D2, Your Highness.

329
00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:12.410
Thank you, R2-D2.

330
00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:17.410
Padmé.

331
00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:20.940
Clean this droid up
as best you can.

332
00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:22.940
It deserves our gratitude.

333
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:26.140
Continue, Captain.

334
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.730
Your Highness,
with your permission...

335
00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.500
we're heading for a remote planet
called Tatooine.

336
00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.820
It's in a system far beyond the reach
of the Trade Federation.

337
00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:39.410
I do not agree
with the Jedi on this.

338
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.340
You must trust my judgment,
Your Highness.

339
00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.260
Hello.

340
00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.210
Sorry. Husa are yousa?

341
00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:52.690
I'm Padmé.

342
00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.690
Mesa Jar Jar Binks.

343
00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.730
You're a Gungan, aren't you?

344
00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:03.380
- How'd you end up here with us?
- My no know.

345
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:07.020
Mesa day starten pitty okeyday
witda brisky morning munchen.

346
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.810
Den boom!
Getten berry scared...

347
00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:13.090
and grabben dat Jedi, and pow--
mesa here.

348
00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:16.810
Mesa getten
berry, berry scared.

349
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:25.820
- That's it-- Tatooine.
- There's a settlement.

350
00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.850
Land near the outskirts.
We don't want to attract attention.

351
00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:49.090
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.
We'll need a new one.

352
00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:51.570
That'll complicate things.
Be wary.

353
00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:54.680
- I sense a disturbance in the Force.
- I feel it also, Master.

354
00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.770
Don't let them send
any transmissions.

355
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:04.920
The sun doen murder to mesa skin.

356
00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:06.480
Wait!

357
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:08.880
Wait.

358
00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:14.920
Her Highness commands you
to take her handmaiden with you.

359
00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:18.640
No more commands
from Her Highness today, Captain.

360
00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:20.750
The spaceport
is not going to be pleasant.

361
00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.920
The queen wishes it.

362
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.870
She's curious about the planet.

363
00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.270
This is not a good idea.
Stay close to me.

364
00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.240
Moisture farms,
for the most part.

365
00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:51.030
Some indigenous tribes
and scavengers.

366
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.960
The few spaceports like this one...

367
00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.280
are havens for those
that don't wish to be found.

368
00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:57.230
Like us.

369
00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.190
Dissen berry, berry bad.

370
00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.160
Icky, icky goo!

371
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:18.950
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

372
00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.240
Good day to you.

373
00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.160
What do you want?

374
00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.240
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

375
00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:36.240
Ah, yes! Nubian.
We have lots of that.

376
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.760
Boy, get in here now!

377
00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.680
My droid has a readout of what I need.

378
00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.790
What took you so long?

379
00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.920
I was cleaning the fan switches.

380
00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.680
Watch the store.
I've got some selling to do.

381
00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:52.920
So, let me take thee out back, huh?

382
00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.840
We'll find what you need.

383
00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.880
Don't touch anything.

384
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.550
- Are you an angel?
- What?

385
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.230
An angel. I heard the deep space
pilots talk about them.

386
00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.110
They're the most beautiful
creatures in the universe.

387
00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.710
They live on the moons of lego,
I think.

388
00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:25.000
You're a funny little boy.
How do you know so much?

389
00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.790
I listen to all the traders
and star pilots who come through here.

390
00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:33.030
I'm a pilot, you know, and someday
I'm gonna fly away from this place.

391
00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:36.940
- You're a pilot?
- Mm-hmm. All my life.

392
00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:39.270
How long have you been here?

393
00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:43.220
Since I was very little.
Three, I think.

394
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:45.940
My mom and I were sold
to Gardulla the Hutt...

395
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:48.660
but she lost us
betting on the Podraces.

396
00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:50.510
You're a slave?

397
00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:54.590
- I'm a person, and my name is Anakin.
- I'm sorry.

398
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:58.300
I don't fully understand.
This is a strange place to me.

399
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:11.710
- I got ya.
- Hey!

400
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:13.500
Hit the nose.

401
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:21.380
A T-14 hyperdrive generator.
Thee in luck.

402
00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:24.020
I'm the only one hereabouts
who has one.

403
00:32:24.150 --> 00:32:27.510
But thee might as well buy a new ship.
It would be cheaper, I think, huh.

404
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:30.430
Saying of which...

405
00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:32.820
how's thee gonna pay
for all this, huh?

406
00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.900
I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

407
00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.770
Republic credits?

408
00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.700
Republic credits are no good out here.
I need something more real.

409
00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:42.810
I don't have anything else,
but credits will do fine.

410
00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:46.410
- No, they won't.
- Credits will do fine.

411
00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.290
No, they won't!

412
00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:52.410
What, you think you're some kind of Jedi,
waving your hand around like that?

413
00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:56.610
I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks
don't work on me. Only money.

414
00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:00.650
No money, no parts, no deal.

415
00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:05.140
And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive,
I promise you that.

416
00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:15.810
Wouldn't have lasted long anyways
if I wasn't so good at building things.

417
00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:21.220
We're leaving.Jar Jar.

418
00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:26.170
I'm glad to have met you, Anakin.

419
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.050
I was glad to meet you too.

420
00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:40.460
Outlanders.
They think we know nothing.

421
00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:42.410
They seemed nice to me.

422
00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:44.370
Clean the racks.

423
00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:45.770
Then you can go home.

424
00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:47.620
Yippee!

425
00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.690
And you're sure there's
nothing left on board?

426
00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:57.610
A few containers of supplies.

427
00:33:57.730 --> 00:34:00.640
The queen's wardrobe, maybe,
but not enough for you to barter with...

428
00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:03.000
not in the amount
you're talking about.

429
00:34:03.130 --> 00:34:05.930
All right. I'm sure
another solution will present itself.

430
00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:07.370
I'll check back later.

431
00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:09.720
Noah gain. Noah gain.

432
00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:12.570
Da beings hereabouts, cawazy!

433
00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:15.040
Wesa be wobbed un crunched.

434
00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:18.200
Not likely. We have nothing of value.
That's our problem.

435
00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.190
Are you going to pay for that?

436
00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.920
It costs seven wupiupi.

437
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.270
Oops.

438
00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.400
Is this yours?

439
00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:52.190
Who, mesa--

440
00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:58.240
Careful, Sebulba.

441
00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.270
He's a big-time outlander.

442
00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.790
I'd hate to see you diced
before we race again.

443
00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:07.630
Next time we race, boy,
it will be the end of you.

444
00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.670
If you weren't a slave,
I'd squash you now.

445
00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.080
Yeah, it'd be a pity
if you had to pay for me.

446
00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.150
- Hi.
- Hi there.

447
00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:20.000
Your buddy here was
about to be turned into orange goo.

448
00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.920
He picked a fight with a Dug...

449
00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.430
an especially dangerous Dug
called Sebulba.

450
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:28.000
Mesa haten crunchen.
Das da las ting mesa want.

451
00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.950
Nevertheless, the boy is right.
You were heading into trouble.

452
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.880
Thanks, my young friend.

453
00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.880
But mesa doen nutten!

454
00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.510
This storm will slow them down.

455
00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.070
Looks pretty bad.

456
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.750
- Panaka.
- Receiving a message from home.

457
00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.600
We'll be right there.

458
00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.830
Here, you'll like these pallies.

459
00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.430
- Here.
- Thank you.

460
00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.750
My bones are aching.

461
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:14.230
Storm's coming up, Ani.
You better get home quick.

462
00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:17.070
- Do you have shelter?
- We'll head back to our ship.

463
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:19.660
- Is it far?
- It's on the outskirts.

464
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:22.060
You'll never reach
the outskirts in time.

465
00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.890
Sandstorms are very, very dangerous.

466
00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.370
Come on.
I'll take you to my place.

467
00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:43.640
Mom!

468
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:47.320
- Mom, I'm home!
- Ah, dissen cosy.

469
00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:49.720
- These are my friends, Mom.
- Hello.

470
00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:53.230
- I'm Qui-Gon Jinn.
- I'm building a droid. You wanna see?

471
00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.640
Your son was kind enough
to offer us shelter.

472
00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.640
Come on. I'll show you 3PO.

473
00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:10.160
Isn't he great?
He's not finished yet.

474
00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.510
He's wonderful.

475
00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.360
You really like him?

476
00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.280
He's a protocol droid
to help Mom. Watch.

477
00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.750
Where is everybody?

478
00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.990
Whoops.

479
00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:28.180
Oh, hello.

480
00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.450
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

481
00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:33.380
How might I serve you?

482
00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.170
- He's perfect.
- Oh. Perfect.

483
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.690
When the storm is over, I'll show you
my racer. I'm building a Podracer.

484
00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:43.450
I'm not sure this floor
is entirely stable.

485
00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:46.650
Hello. I don't believe
we have been introduced.

486
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.650
R2-D2.
A pleasure to meet you.

487
00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.690
I am C-3PO,
human cyborg relations.

488
00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:59.290
I beg your pardon,
but what do you mean, " naked''?

489
00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:04.020
My parts are showing?
My goodness!

490
00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:10.810
The death toll is catastrophic.

491
00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:13.200
We must bow to their wishes.

492
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.280
You must contact me.

493
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.960
It's a trick.
Send no reply.

494
00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.990
Send no transmissions of any kind.

495
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:24.950
It sounds like bait
to establish a connection trace.

496
00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.870
What if it is true,
and the people are dying?

497
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.360
Either way,
we're running out of time.

498
00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:46.490
Tatooine is sparsely populated.

499
00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:49.280
If the trace was correct,
I will find them quickly, Master.

500
00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:51.210
Move against the Jedi first.

501
00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:53.920
You will then have no difficulty
in taking the queen to Naboo...

502
00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:55.850
to sign the treaty.

503
00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:58.040
At last we will reveal ourselves
to the Jedi.

504
00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:00.480
At last we will have revenge.

505
00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:03.360
You have been well-trained,
my young apprentice.

506
00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:05.760
They will be no match for you.

507
00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:14.280
All slaves have a transmitter
placed inside their bodies somewhere.

508
00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:18.210
I've been working on a scanner
to try and locate mine.

509
00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:21.690
- Any attempt to escape--
- And they blow you up!

510
00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:24.080
How wude!

511
00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:26.520
I can't believe
there's still slavery in the galaxy.

512
00:39:26.650 --> 00:39:28.450
The Republic's antislavery laws--

513
00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:30.800
The Republic doesn't exist out here.

514
00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:33.000
We must survive on our own.

515
00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:35.400
Xcuse me.

516
00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:39.840
Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

517
00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.690
They have Podracing
on Malastare.

518
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:44.400
Very fast, very dangerous.

519
00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:46.970
I'm the only human who can do it.

520
00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:49.970
You must have Jedi reflexes
if you race pods.

521
00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:52.370
Don't do that again.

522
00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:00.080
You're a Jedi knight, aren't you?

523
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:05.680
- What makes you think that?
- I saw your laser sword.

524
00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:08.560
Only Jedis carry
that kind of weapon.

525
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:11.680
Perhaps I killed a Jedi
and took it from him.

526
00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:13.370
I don't think so.

527
00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:15.560
No one can kill a Jedi.

528
00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:18.330
I wish that were so.

529
00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:20.410
I had a dream I was a Jedi.

530
00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:23.570
I came back here
and freed all the slaves.

531
00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:26.890
- Have you come to free us?
- No, I'm afraid not.

532
00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:31.160
I think you have.
Why else would you be here?

533
00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:38.490
I can see there's
no fooling you, Anakin.

534
00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:41.490
We're on our way to Coruscant,
the central system in the Republic...

535
00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:43.520
on a very important mission.

536
00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:46.560
How did you end up out here
in the outer rim?

537
00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:50.160
Our ship was damaged, and we're
stranded here until we can repair it.

538
00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:54.440
I can help.
I can fix anything.

539
00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:56.000
I believe you can.

540
00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:58.800
But first we must acquire
the parts we need.

541
00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:01.520
Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

542
00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:05.040
These junk dealers
must have a weakness of some kind.

543
00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:09.290
Gambling. Everything here revolves
around betting on those awful races.

544
00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:10.600
Podracing.

545
00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:13.530
Greed can be a powerful ally.

546
00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:16.400
I built a racer.
It's the fastest ever.

547
00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:18.730
There's a big race tomorrow
on Boonta Eve.

548
00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:20.730
You could enter my pod.

549
00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:24.560
- Anakin, Watto won't let you.
- Watto doesn't know I've built it.

550
00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:26.490
You could make him think
it was yours...

551
00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:28.730
and get him
to let me pilot it for you.

552
00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:30.360
I don't want you to race.
It's awful.

553
00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:32.880
I die every time
Watto makes you do it.

554
00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:35.050
But, Mom, I love it.

555
00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:38.560
The prize money would more than pay
for the parts they need.

556
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:40.880
Anakin.

557
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.640
Your mother's right.

558
00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:46.720
Is there anyone friendly to the Republic
who can help us?

559
00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.750
No.

560
00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:59.080
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this
universe is nobody helps each other.

561
00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:06.470
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want
to put your son in danger.

562
00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:08.430
We'll find some other way.

563
00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.150
There is no other way.

564
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:17.420
I may not like it,
but he can help you.

565
00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:20.070
He was meant to help you.

566
00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:34.870
Are you sure about this?

567
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:37.500
Trusting our fate
to a boy we hardly know?

568
00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:39.590
The queen will not approve.

569
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:41.510
The queen doesn't need to know.

570
00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:44.150
Well, I don't approve.

571
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:47.740
The boy tells me you want
to sponsor him in the race.

572
00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:49.430
How can you do this?

573
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:52.700
Not on the Republic credits,
I think.

574
00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:54.900
My ship will be the entry fee.

575
00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:57.030
Not bad!

576
00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:59.980
Not bad, huh?
Nubian, huh?

577
00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:03.260
It's in good order,
except for the parts I need.

578
00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:05.780
What would the boy ride?

579
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:09.300
He smashed up my pod in the last race.
It would take some long time to fix it.

580
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:11.660
It wasn't my fault.
Really.

581
00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:13.350
Sebulba flashed me with his vents.

582
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:16.700
I actually saved the pod, mostly.

583
00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:20.140
That you did.

584
00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:22.930
The boy's good.
No doubts there, huh?

585
00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:25.450
I have acquired a pod
in a game of chance.

586
00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:27.170
The fastest ever built.

587
00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:32.220
I hope you didn't kill
anyone I know for it, huh?

588
00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:37.500
So, you supply the pod
and the entry fee...

589
00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:38.950
and I supply the boy.

590
00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:42.780
We split the winnings 50-50,
I think, huh?

591
00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:44.710
If it's going to be 50-50...

592
00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:47.340
I suggest you front the cash
for the entry.

593
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:49.430
If we win...

594
00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:53.180
you keep all the winnings,
minus the cost of the parts I need.

595
00:43:53.310 --> 00:43:56.380
And if we lose,
you keep my ship.

596
00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:00.100
Either way, you win.

597
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:06.940
Deal!

598
00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:16.020
Your friend
is a foolish one, methinks.

599
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:26.470
What if this plan fails, Master?

600
00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:29.180
We could be stuck here
a very long time.

601
00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:31.740
Well, it's too dangerous
to call for help...

602
00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:35.100
and a ship without a power supply
isn't going to get us anywhere.

603
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:37.110
And...

604
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:39.030
there's something about this boy.

605
00:44:45.590 --> 00:44:47.820
You should be very proud of your son.

606
00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:50.780
He gives without any thought
of reward.

607
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:53.660
He knows nothing of greed.

608
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:54.830
He has--

609
00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:57.590
He has special powers.

610
00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:00.460
Yes.

611
00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:03.100
He can see things
before they happen.

612
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:05.900
That's why he appears
to have such quick reflexes.

613
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:07.830
It's a Jedi trait.

614
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:10.620
He deserves better
than a slave's life.

615
00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:13.980
Had he been born in the Republic,
we would have identified him early.

616
00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:19.900
The Force is unusually strong with him.
That much is clear.

617
00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:21.690
Who was his father?

618
00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:26.130
There was no father.

619
00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:30.740
I carried him,
I gave birth, I raised him.

620
00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.970
I can't explain what happened.

621
00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.300
Can you help him?

622
00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:39.220
I don't know.

623
00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:45.090
I didn't actually come here
to free slaves.

624
00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:59.500
Wow, a real astro droid!

625
00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:04.930
- How do you get so lucky?
- That isn't the half of it.

626
00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:07.880
- I'm in the Boonta race tomorrow.
- What?

627
00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:09.650
With this?

628
00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:12.410
You're such a joker, Ani.

629
00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:15.600
- You've been working on that for years.
- It's never gonna run.

630
00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:17.800
Come on.
Let's go and play ball.

631
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:21.080
Keep racing, Ani.
You're gonna be bug squash.

632
00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:31.570
Keep away from
those energy binders.

633
00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:35.000
If your hand gets caught in the beam,
it's gonna go numb for hours.

634
00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:36.450
Okay.

635
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:42.440
My tongue is fat.

636
00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:45.530
My tongue-- Wrench.

637
00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:48.210
Where is de wrench?
Oh, dare it is.

638
00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:53.970
I'm stuck.

639
00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:57.920
You know, I find that Jar Jar creature
to be a little odd.

640
00:46:59.690 --> 00:47:02.410
You don't even know
if this thing's gonna run.

641
00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:04.520
- It will.
- I think it's time we found out.

642
00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:06.770
- Here, use this power charge.
- Yes, sir!

643
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:08.850
Come on, Kitster.
Let's move away.

644
00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:11.090
My mouth.

645
00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:12.480
Ani, I'm stuck.

646
00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:19.560
My tongue is fat.

647
00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:22.520
You're quite right.
He's very odd indeed.

648
00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:26.610
Thank you.

649
00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:28.080
Go.

650
00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:45.480
It's working!
It's working!

651
00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:58.080
Stay still, Ani.
Let me clean this cut.

652
00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:01.960
There's so many.
Do they all have a system of planets?

653
00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:03.890
Most of them.

654
00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:05.890
Has anyone been to 'em all?

655
00:48:07.530 --> 00:48:08.680
Not likely.

656
00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:11.890
I wanna be the first one
to see 'em all.

657
00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:15.330
Ani, bedtime!

658
00:48:15.450 --> 00:48:18.090
There we are.
Good as new.

659
00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:20.960
Ani, I'm not gonna tell you again.

660
00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:24.370
- What are you doing?
- Checking your blood for infections.

661
00:48:24.490 --> 00:48:25.970
Go on.

662
00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:27.970
You have a big day tomorrow.

663
00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:29.890
Sleep well, Ani.

664
00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:34.440
- Obi-Wan?
- Yes, Master?

665
00:48:34.570 --> 00:48:37.160
I need an analysis
of this blood sample I'm sending you.

666
00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:38.930
Wait a minute.

667
00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:42.450
I need a midi-chlorian count.

668
00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:47.800
The reading is off the chart.

669
00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:49.730
Over 20,000.

670
00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:53.320
Even Master Yoda doesn't have
a midi-chlorian count that high.

671
00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:55.170
No Jedi has.

672
00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:57.250
What does that mean?

673
00:48:58.090 --> 00:48:59.650
I'm not sure.

674
00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:09.480
I wanna see your spaceship
the moment the race is over.

675
00:50:09.610 --> 00:50:11.280
Patience, my blue friend.

676
00:50:11.410 --> 00:50:13.560
You'll have your winnings
before the suns set.

677
00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:15.410
And we'll be far away from here.

678
00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:19.410
Not if your ship belongs to me,
I think, huh?

679
00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:22.760
I warn you, no funny business.

680
00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:25.880
- You don't think Anakin can win?
- Don't get me wrongo.

681
00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:28.360
I have great faith in the boy.

682
00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.520
He's a credit to your race...

683
00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.710
but Sebulba there
is going to win, I think.

684
00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.430
Oh, no!

685
00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.190
Why do you think that?

686
00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.120
He always wins!

687
00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.390
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.

688
00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:53.750
- I'll take that bet.
- What?

689
00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:57.680
I'll wager my new racing pod
against, say...

690
00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:59.600
the boy and his mother.

691
00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:03.270
No pod is worth two slaves,
not by a long shot.

692
00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.830
The boy, then.

693
00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.190
We'll let fate decide, huh?

694
00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:17.600
I just happen to have
a chance cube here.

695
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.630
Blue, it's the boy.

696
00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:21.830
Red...

697
00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:24.760
his mother.

698
00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:36.390
You won this small toss,
outlander...

699
00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:38.560
but you won't win the race!

700
00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:40.670
So it makes little difference!

701
00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:54.790
Better stop your friend's betting
or I'll end up owning him too.

702
00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.790
- What'd he mean by that?
- I'll tell you later.

703
00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:02.240
Good morning.

704
00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.920
Oh, my.
Space travel sounds rather perilous.

705
00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:12.750
I can assure you, they will never get me
onto one of those dreadful starships.

706
00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:16.110
This is so wizard, Ani.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.

707
00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:17.280
Do what?

708
00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.310
Finish the race, of course.

709
00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:22.110
You've never won a race?

710
00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:24.830
Well, not exactly.

711
00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:26.870
Not even finished?

712
00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.350
Kitster's right.
I will this time.

713
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:31.430
Of course you will.

714
00:52:59.870 --> 00:53:01.620
That's absolutely right.

715
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:06.580
And a big turnout here from all corners
of the outer rim territories.

716
00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:10.170
I see the contestants are making
their way out onto the starting grid.

717
00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:14.900
I see Ben Quadinaros
from the Tund System.

718
00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:22.690
Two-time winner Boles Roor.

719
00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:26.860
Sebulba!

720
00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:39.820
And in the front row,
nearside pole position...

721
00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:41.850
Mawhonic!

722
00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:44.980
A hearty hello...

723
00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:48.650
to Clegg Holdfast
and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!

724
00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:54.420
And back again,
it's the mighty Dud Bolt...

725
00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:58.930
with that incredible racing machine,
the Vulptereen 327.

726
00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:04.330
And hoping for a big win today...

727
00:54:04.450 --> 00:54:08.680
Ody Mandrell,
with his record-setting pit droid team.

728
00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:16.490
And a late entry,
young Anakin Skywalker...

729
00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:17.840
a local boy.

730
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:22.600
I see the flags are moving
out onto the track.

731
00:54:42.010 --> 00:54:43.490
Be safe.

732
00:54:43.610 --> 00:54:45.840
I will, Mom. I promise.

733
00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:03.930
You won't walk away from this one...

734
00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:06.200
you slave scum.

735
00:55:06.330 --> 00:55:09.450
Don't count on it, slime ball.

736
00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:11.840
You're bantha fodder!

737
00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:18.370
- You all set, Ani?
- Yep.

738
00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:20.050
Right.

739
00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:26.520
Remember, concentrate
on the moment.

740
00:55:26.650 --> 00:55:30.240
Feel, don't think.
Use your instincts.

741
00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.920
I will.

742
00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:34.160
May the Force be with you.

743
00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:44.670
Jabba the Hutt.

744
00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:58.710
Welcome.

745
00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:02.760
Begin the race!

746
00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:15.920
Hey, looks like
they're clearing the grid.

747
00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:18.880
- Is he nervous?
- He's fine.

748
00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:23.190
You Jedi are far too reckless.
The queen is not--

749
00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:26.070
The queen trusts my judgment,
young handmaiden.

750
00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:28.320
You should too.

751
00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:30.430
You assume too much.

752
00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:33.470
Start your engines.

753
00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:14.360
Oh, dissen gonna be messy.
Me no watch'n!

754
00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:34.790
Oh, no!

755
00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:43.350
Wait.
Little Skywalker has stalled.

756
00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:57.440
It looks like Quadinaros
is having engine trouble also.

757
00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:00.190
Come on, Ani!

758
00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:07.870
And there goes Skywalker!

759
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.400
Go, Ani, go!

760
00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.560
He will be hard-pressed
to catch up with the leaders.

761
00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.440
Looks like a few Tusken Raiders
are camped out...

762
00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:27.760
on the canyon dune turn.

763
00:59:38.530 --> 00:59:42.080
There goes Quadinaros'
power coupling.

764
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:10.810
Oh, no!

765
01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:17.210
Where is Master Anakin?

766
01:00:20.330 --> 01:00:22.450
Look. Here he comes.

767
01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:27.440
It looks like Skywalker
is moving up in the field.

768
01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:29.640
Yay! Yippee!

769
01:00:36.850 --> 01:00:40.290
He has to complete
two more circuits? Oh, dear.

770
01:01:45.130 --> 01:01:46.930
Skywalker's
spinning out of control!

771
01:02:42.490 --> 01:02:46.280
I don't care what universe you're from.
That's gotta hurt!

772
01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:54.690
Here he comes!

773
01:02:54.810 --> 01:02:57.800
At the start of the third and final lap,
Sebulba's in the lead...

774
01:02:57.930 --> 01:03:00.320
followed closely by Skywalker!

775
01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:01.280
Go, Ani!

776
01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:29.440
Skywalker's been forced
onto the service ramp!

777
01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:51.570
It's Skywalker!

778
01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:53.760
Sebulba!

779
01:03:53.890 --> 01:03:57.960
Amazing! A quick control thrust,
and he's back on course!

780
01:03:58.090 --> 01:03:59.760
Did he crash-ed?

781
01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:42.120
Skywalker's in trouble!
Sebulba takes the lead!

782
01:05:32.970 --> 01:05:34.560
He's catching Sebulba!

783
01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:38.040
Careful, Ani. Careful, Ani!

784
01:06:07.170 --> 01:06:09.440
That little human being
is out of his mind!

785
01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:11.630
They're side by side!

786
01:06:39.110 --> 01:06:40.910
- Yippee!
- Yay!

787
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:46.590
I can't believe it.

788
01:06:46.710 --> 01:06:48.540
The crowds are going nuts!
